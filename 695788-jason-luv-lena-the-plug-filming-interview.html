We've seen an increasing number of celebrities sign up for the website. Among them are <a href=# class=text-word rel>Iggy Azalea</a> and Coco Austin. Still, the photos and videos they send out aren't nearly as salacious as the video Lena The Plug recently made with Jason Luv. As you've probably heard, the adult actress is the wife of No Jumper creator Adam22. After seven years of marriage, he recently gave her his permission to sleep with another man for the camera.</p><p>The weeks since have seen their sex tape and the discourse surrounding it go viral online. Most of the commentary is labelling Adam a "cuck." Regardless of what haters have to say, he and Lena insist that their relationship is now stronger than ever. He's also made it known that celebrities are now appearing in the porn star's DMs. She's already spoken candidly about her experience filming with Jason Luv.

The X-rated entertainer noted that he didn't do anything extra special to prepare for the scene, however, he did make sure to hit Lena with "all the best moves" during their brief time being intimate together.</p><p>Adam22's fans obviously aren't pleased to see him encouraging his wife to sleep with other men â€“ especially one with a resume like Jason Luv's. Nevertheless, he continues to support Lena's NSFW endeavours, even surprising her with a new luxury vehicle to celebrate her sex tape's success.
