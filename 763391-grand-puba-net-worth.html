Alongside Sadat X, Lord Jamar, and DJ Alamo, Puba played a critical role in shaping the group's debut album, One for All, released in 1990. The album is celebrated for its socially conscious lyrics and fusion of jazz and reggae influences. It is also considered a classic in hip-hop circles. However, Puba's unique delivery and insightful verses stood out, paving the way for his solo career.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Following his departure from Brand Nubian in the early '90s, Grand Puba embarked on a solo journey to cement his music legacy further. His debut album, Reel to Reel (1992), showcased his ability to blend political commentary with humor, all while maintaining a smooth flow that became his trademark. Hits like "360° (What Goes Around)" dominated the charts and demonstrated Puba's prowess as a solo artist, distinguishing him from his peers.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-a-legacy-of-innovation-amp-influence>A Legacy Of Innovation & Influence</h2></span><p>Grand Puba and Kanye West during G.O.O.D Music and Groovevolt.com Presents.
