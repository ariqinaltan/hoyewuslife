News</a>) that marriage and kids weren't on the table with Hanisch for a while. "We've talked about that we don't want to talk about it for two years," she said. "It's just like ... then you have to take care of them, the kids. I don't even have a plant! I can't. I'm not going to water that."</p><p>However, she may have changed her mind. Before the split in early May 2017, Schumer openly expressed a desire to marry Hanisch, even in just in the common law sense. "Well, I never had marriage or children as a goal, but I have an interest in making a commitment and saying I am going to stick with you, and I am not going to have sex with anybody else ever again," she told <a href=#>News.Com.Au</a>. "I am going to be someone who will witness your life and I am going to be your partner."</p><p>Also in early May 2017, she told <a href=#>E! News</a> that she was considering having kids. "It changes for me sometimes," she said. "I'm like, 'That would be amazing and I definitely want that' and then other times, I'm like, 'I don't know' and then there are so many options â€” there's adoption, there's your own." If her and Hanisch's visions of the future didn't line up, it may have been best for them to cut their losses and move on.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmb21oaIRwvsSao2aqlZbAsLqMmqSyZaOYtba5xKtkm52eYrWiusismqFlkqe8rLGO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
