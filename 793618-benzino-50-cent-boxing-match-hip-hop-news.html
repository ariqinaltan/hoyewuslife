He says that since Diddy's allegedly been messing with the mother of 50 Cent's child, there's bound to be some strong feelings involved. Benzino was then asked whether or not he'd ever consider taking on 50 Cent in the ring. With no hesitation, he said yes, arguing that size doesn't really matter when it comes to boxing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Being big don’t mean nothing in boxing</a>, history has shown us that,” he described. “50’s been shot in the face before so that counts. He had to get reconstructive surgery; he’s not gonna be able to take any old punch in his face.” Benzino continued, claiming that with a few months of training under his belt, he'd have it in the bag.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-benzino-is-confident>Benzino Is Confident</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“If we were to box in a boxing match and I were to train for a couple months, hell yeah I could box 50," he said. As for whether or not the same would also apply to a street fight, he claims it would. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"I’m gonna pick me every time,"</a> Benzino explained. 50 Cent has yet to respond to the apparent challenge.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Benzino claiming that he'd be willing to box 50 Cent? What about him saying that he'd have <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">a good chance at winning</a> after a bit of training?
