A weird statement, but it's true! Ballerini, Chase Stokes, and Madelyn Cline are all in the entertainment industry, so it seemed like only a matter of time before they would have a run-in with each other. When it was revealed all three would be attending the Video Music Awards, the public awaited the nail-biting interaction. But, there was no need to worry because it was all drama-free!</p><p>The "If You Go Down" singer walked the red carpet hand-in-hand with Stokes, both wearing red themselves, per <a href=#>J-14.</a> As for Cline, she dazzled on the red carpet solo. The three didn't have any interaction during or before the show, but after the show, it was clear there was no tension between Ballerini and Cline. The "Outer Banks" star posted photos of her stunning red carpet look to <a href=#>Instagram</a>, and while fans flooded the comments with admiration, so did Ballerini.&nbsp;</p><p>The country music star commented, "You looked a ridiculous level of stunning and I'm glad I finally got to hug your neck." The love wasn't one-sided, Cline responded to Ballerini with just as sweet of a message. "So happy I got to squeeze you, gorgeous gorgeous girl," the "Outer Banks" star told Ballerini. No drama to be seen here, so fans can breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxgZ4N3hY6dpp6rXaCyrb%2FEmmSbmZyhsrO1zaJknKCRqLJuv9Ooop6rXZrFbrnAnZylsZ5isK21zZ5koJ2kYq6tu82gZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
