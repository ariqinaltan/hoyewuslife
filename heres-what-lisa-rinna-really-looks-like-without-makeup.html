Rinna's <a href=#>photo</a>, which was reposted by the magazine, was met with plenty of praise and some pushback from commenters. <a href=#>People</a> captured a now-deleted interaction between the actor and a hater. Someone wrote, "Ok! Put the makeup on please hahahahaha." Rinna was quick to retort, "Let's see you without make up Hon."</p><p dir=ltr>The negativity on her People photo didn't stop Rinna from continuing to show off her natural appearance. In a since-deleted post (via <a href=#>The Blast</a>), the star shared a stunning selfie with a sassy caption. "Someone just dared me to post a photo with no [makeup] on," Rinna wrote. "Real deal here this is no make up." Her glowing skin and smug smile is the perfect clapback to anyone who doubted her authenticity.</p><p dir=ltr>In the past, Rinna hasn't even needed a dare to share her bare-faced looks. After Kyle Richards shared an exhausted, post-"RHOBH" filming selfie to her Instagram Stories (via the&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a>), Rinna posted one of her own in solidarity. Playing off her co-star's caption, Rinna wrote, "Double hot mess express." For these stunners, there's certainly an emphasis on the "hot," though.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcnBibIZ6e8eeqZ6rXay1osCMpaCsmV2ntq%2B6wGapnpmcocZuuM6ooqxlnJ64pnnWoquhp6Wpeq6typ6sqWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
