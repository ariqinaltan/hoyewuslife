"He gets 15% credit of 34 days," Cuniff also explained. “Herriford also is crediting his 40 days of house arrest, for a total of 305 days. He’ll request bail pending appeal, which will be heard Aug. 15. (Extremely unlikely to be granted)." For obvious reasons, the sentencing has gotten <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">social media users talking</a>. Though some have taken to Twitter to defend Lanez, others will certainly be disappointed that he'll only be serving around nine years.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-meghann-cuniff-says-tory-lanez-will-serve-closer-to-nine-years>Meghann Cuniff Says Tory Lanez Will Serve Closer To Nine Years</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In addition to her Tweet about Lanez' time served being deducted from his sentence, Cuniff additionally posted a statement shared by Deputy D.A. Kathy Ta. "I cannot emphasize enough the power that it must've taken someone with that level of trauma that she’s undergone and the willingness to come forward after being vilified online," she said of Megan Thee Stallion.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Prior to being sentenced, Lanez <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">apologized</a> for his behavior, even referring to Megan Thee Stallion as his "friend." “I want to apologize for everything I took part in and even being in that situation & for everything I did wrong I take full responsibility and I’m mature enough to say I was wrong,” he told Judge David Herriford. “<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">I’m not asking for special treatment</a>," he also claimed. "Or for you to go beyond the scope of what you do. I’m just asking for you to give me the chance to be a better father, mentor, and to be better for my employees." He additionally claimed that he "still cares dearly" about Megan Thee Stallion, which then sparked some additional debate among users.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Caroline Fisher is a News Writer at HotNewHipHop from Chicago, Illinois.
