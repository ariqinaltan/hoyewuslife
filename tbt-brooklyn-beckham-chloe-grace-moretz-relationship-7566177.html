Chloë Grace was 17 years old, while Brooklyn was 15 and would reportedly attend the trendy spin class often with his famous parents, Victoria and David Beckham.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In an interview with Company several weeks later, Chloë Grace revealed that after their first spin-class interaction, she and Brooklyn <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>“just kinda started hanging out.”</a> Hanging out included going to Ed Sheeran concerts, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>skateboarding</a> by the beach in Santa Monica, and, of course, SoulCycling.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the two were coy about the status of their relationship and never confirmed (or denied) they were a couple until after they broke up and got back together in April 2016. "We're in a relationship, it's fine, it's no biggie,” Moretz said during a May 2016 episode of Watch What Happens Live! With Andy Cohen. “The more I don't make it serious, the more people don't care, so yes, we're in a relationship."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A week later, Chloë Grace and Brooklyn made things red-carpet official at the premiere of the actress’s new movie Bad Neighbors 2.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They broke up for a second time in September 2016 but got back together again a year later when Brooklyn moved to New York to study photography at Parsons.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Why We Loved Them: </strong>&nbsp;No one did couple dressing better than Chloë Grace and Brooklyn (the eldest of the Beckham children learned from the best, his mom and dad, who wore plenty of matching outfits way back when). From his-and-hers denim and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Van sneakers</a> to laid-back airport fashion, the pair were almost always stylishly in sync – no matter where they were going.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>When They Peaked:</strong> Their ultimate matching moment also happened to be super meaningful. In November 2017, Chloë Grace and Brooklyn symbolized their love with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>identical gold rings</a> engraved with each other’s initials.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>The Breakup: </strong>By April 2018, their relationship had officially come to an end, days after Brooklyn was spotted kissing Playboy model Lexi Wood at a tattoo parlor in Los Angeles when it was presumed he was still with Chloë Grace.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Neither Moretz nor Beckham made a statement about why they broke up. However, the actress did kind of address the split with a shady Instagram post. Seemingly accusing Brooklyn of cheating on her, Chloë Grace posted a screenshot of Cardi B's "Be Careful," which is a song about infidelity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August of that same year, she elaborated on the split, telling The Sunday Times, '"Breakups are hard across the board. But when every verified account on Twitter posts something about me, I get tagged. And every major publication is verified. So anytime they post something about a certain relationship, it pops up on my phone, which is how I find out about 90 percent of things."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Where Are They Now: </strong>After his breakup with Moretz, Beckham had two casual flings with musician Lexy Panterra and model Alex Lee Aillón that summer before settling down with singer Hana Cross. They broke up in September 2019 after dating for almost a year, and a month later, he met his now-wife Nicola Peltz at a Halloween party. They went Instagram official in 2020, and six months later, they were engaged. Beckham and Peltz eventually tied the knot in May 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Brooklyn has tested out many different career paths — from photography to modeling — his most current profession is celebrity chef. His social media cooking series, titled "Cookin' with Brooklyn," has been known to feature Beckham blow-torching grilled cheese sandwiches and cooking pasta in a wheel of cheese.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few months after her relationship with Brooklyn ended, Chloë Grace was rumored to be dating actor Dylan O'Brien. They were photographed together on a couple of occasions, but nothing serious came from it. Currently, Moretz is in a relationship with model Kate Harrison. They soft-launched their relationship with a cute Valentine's Day post in February 2023, but they were actually linked five years earlier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Moretz continued to thrive as an actress, starring in movies such as Greta, The Addams Family, and most recently, lending her voice for the role of Nimona in the animated Netflix film Nimona, which came out last month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">#TBT: Check in every Thursday as we throw it back to some of our favorite celebrity couples of all time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705urZpqipLysuNinZJudk6C1ormMnJ%2Blp5VitLOtwp5kpqeimsG7edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWRwbWZrfniD</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
