As he spoke, an aerial view of the massive structure under construction was shown as the alleged project of the hotel he is currently building in Nigeria.

Although many doubted the video, others ran with the narrative as they discussed the hope for Nigeria’s economy through the alleged venture.</p><p class=align-left>A TikToker, Ambad (@ambabdirahmannurd) from Somalia, wondered why Elon Musk did not consider his country for such a big project. He said:</p>“Elon why dont u build a big Hotel in beautiful beach in Mogadishu, Somalia (sic).”<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c445232afb44da95.jpg><p class=align-left>Another person, Emmy (@Emmyleefund), praised the billionaire for the supposed lofty project and said:</p>“Wow, thanks for bringing Nigeria up.”<p class=align-left>Those were not all. One user, Crystal (@crystalrosemine), saw a job opportunity and tapped into what the project could offer him.

All these are technology-related ventures, and the billionaire has none known to the public related to the real estate business.</p><h2>Verification</h2><p class=align-left>Suspecting the alleged video to be deepfake, DUBAWA ran an analysis of the clip on Deepware.ai, a tool that vets videos to determine the elements of deepfake therein. Interestingly, the results from the test reveal the alleged video is indeed a deepfake.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fabc96b73c657c03.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>2023 election fashion: Dino Melaye rocks N1.5m designer jacket, Nigerians react</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1f11214a0b9c4350.png><p class=align-left>What are deepfakes videos?</p><p class=align-left>Deepfake videos have been popular in recent times. Combining the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), deepfakes, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Norton</a>, combines both AL and ML to overlap a person’s face over another one to make a false identity real. While deepfakes could be hard to spot, some features give them away.</p><h2>How to spot deepfakes</h2><p class=align-left>Establishing that the alleged video is deepfake, DUBAWA looked out for features such as jerky body moves, a lack of emotions, and artificial voicing.</p><p class=align-left>- Jerky body movement</p><p class=align-left>Seconds into the video, Elon Musk's head moved upwards in a way that shows that its frames were not natural. It was a jerky movement that an attentive person could have only spotted.</p><p class=align-left>- Stark lack of emotions</p><p class=align-left>Throughout the short video, the fake Elon Musk’s face was bland as his eyes rolled coldly from side to side. He announced as if it was nothing exciting to look forward to. See a screenshot below:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/feaea84e7ff4c7df.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"He dey use Made in Lagos": Moment Wizkid's fan used singer's song to guess Nigeria's capital, says it's Lagos</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ff4ec639878d97b9.png><p class=align-left>- Artificial voicing</p><p class=align-left>While the AI tried too much to make the voice sound like Elon Musk’s, it failed at syncing the man’s lip movement to the words spoken in the video. Also, there’s a robotic flair to the voice. It is similar to one of the robotic sounds identified by All Sounds as <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">“human has been neutralised”</a>.</p><h2>The alleged footage of the structure is not in Nigeria</h2><p class=align-left>Taking the verification further, DUBAWA made a <a href=#>Google</a> lens search on the alleged structure Mr Musk is said to be currently building in Nigeria. The results revealed the structure is the Tesla Factory in Austin, Texas, that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bloomberg</a> featured in a report about Mr Musk’s automobile company in the US.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fabc96b73c657c03.jpg><p class=align-left>A screenshot of the reverse image search result.
