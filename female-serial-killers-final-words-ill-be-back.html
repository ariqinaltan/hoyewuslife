I'll be back."</p><p>Wuornos, 46, was convicted 10 years ago of killing six middle-aged men who she picked up while working as a prostitute along Interstate 75 in Florida. She was initially charged with the murder of Richard Mallory, the owner of an electronics store who she shot dead in 1989.</p><p>Wuornos pleaded not guilty, arguing in court that she had killed Mallory in self-defence. But after she was found guilty, she pleaded guilty to five further killings telling the state's Supreme Court: "I'm one who seriously hates human life and would kill again."</p><p>The life and crimes of Wuornos, the 10th woman to be executed in the United States since the resumption of the death penalty in 1976, inspired two films, a number of books and an opera, Wuornos, by composer Carla Lucero.</p><p>"On the one hand, it's a horrible story about a woman who was betrayed from infancy," said Lucero.</p><p>"But it's also one of the most beautiful love stories I've ever heard.</p><p>"Aileen loved another woman so much she sacrificed her own life.</p><p>"Of course, it's also totally dysfunctional, but most good love stories, in opera especially, are the most dysfunctional things you can imagine."</p><p>At her 1992 trial, the court was told that Wuornos, a lesbian, was repeatedly abused as a child.</p><p>Wuornos claimed she was an "exit-to-exit" highway prostitute who made US$1000 ($2090) a week having sex with 40 to 50 men.</p><p>At the time of the her arrest, she was living with her girlfriend, Tyria Moore, who testified against her.</p><p>Some of their income came from pawning goods stolen from the murdered men.</p><p>Having spent 10 years on death row, Wuornos fired her lawyers and dropped her right to appeals, actions that fuelled the debate over her sanity and competence.</p><p>Florida Governor Jeb Bush issued a halt of execution and ordered a mental examination.</p><p>He lifted the stay last week after three psychiatrists who interviewed her concluded that she understood why she was being executed.</p><p>The last member of the media to interview her, British documentary maker Nick Broomfield, said he spoke to her on Tuesday.</p><p>"My conclusion from the interview is, today we are executing someone who is mad.</p><p>"Here is someone who has totally lost her mind," he said yesterday.</p><p>Wuornos' execution was witnessed by Leta Prater whose brother, Troy Burress, was among the killer's victims.</p><p>"She had death on her face," she said afterwards.</p><p>"She looked rough, but she always looked rough. I, for one, am glad she's gone."</p><p>- <a href=#>INDEPENDENT</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmsKeiobFwssSmmKWdXaiys7XApWSkoZyhsrO%2FjJ%2Bgp5mcYsSwvsOsZKKknGKvpnnBmpqkZ2dsmZWeuW%2BLgY5%2Fa6WRpJKDeJGSY2igj4GgaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
