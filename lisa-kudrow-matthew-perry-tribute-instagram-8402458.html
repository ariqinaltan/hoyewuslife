After her fellow Friends co-stars, Matt LeBlanc, Courtney Cox, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Aniston</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>David Schwimmer</a>, shared their tributes to the late actor earlier this week, Kudrow posted her own heartfelt homage on Wednesday, thanking Perry for all that she “learned about grace and love through knowing” him.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“​​Shot the pilot, Friends Like Us, got picked up then immediately, we were at the NBC Upfronts. Then … You suggested we play poker AND made it so much fun while we initially bonded. Thank you for that,” Kudrow captioned a Polaroid of her and Perry posing arm-in-arm at an NBC event.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Thank you for making me laugh so hard at something you said, that my muscles ached, and tears poured down my face EVERY DAY,” the actress continued. “Thank you for your open heart in a six way relationship that required compromise. And a lot of ‘talking.’”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Referencing Perry’s struggle with addiction, Kudrow added, “Thank you for showing up at work when you weren’t well and then, being completely brilliant. Thank you for the best 10 years a person gets to have. Thank you for trusting me.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Thank you for all I learned about GRACE and LOVE through knowing you,” she concluded. “Thank you for the time I got to have with you, Matthew.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kudrow’s post wasn’t the only time that she’s referenced Perry’s struggle with addiction throughout their friendship. In 2022, she wrote the foreword to the actor’s memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing, where she opened up about not realizing the extent of the actor’s struggles until years later.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the passage, she wrote that reading the memoir was “the first time I’m hearing what living with and surviving addiction really was. Matthew has told me some things, but not in this kind of detail,” later adding, “He has survived impossible odds, but I had no idea how many times he almost didn’t make it. I’m glad you’re here, Matty. Good for you. I love you.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57y6KqmmWbqrGzu9ZmpJqspJ2yuHnPnqmrsV2pv6qu1K2cZqGeqMGis9GapGZwZGV%2FdYGX</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
