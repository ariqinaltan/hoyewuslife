Our last day of business was December 31, 2023,” the statement read.</p><p>“We did not come to this decision lightly nor quickly.”</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Store Closing ">Read More on Store Closing</h2><p>The company claims that despite having loyal customers, it was not enough to help the company survive.</p><p>"While the support and loyalty of our customers has been strong, sales are not enough to continue doing business in the state of California, allowing us to service our lease obligations and pay our treasured employees a living wage without passing those costs directly on to you," the statement explained.</p><p>It had notified its employees that it was closing all six of its locations on New Year's Day, according to an email obtained by <a aria-label="KTLA-TV. (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">KTLA-TV.</a></p><p>In the email, it explained that employees will still receive their regular wages up until January 5, including unused PTO and a severance package.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>“We want to tell you that we are very grateful for your loyal service,” the letter read.</p><p>The bakery was founded by Jane Lockhart, who opened the first Sweet Lady Jane in <a href=#>California</a>, on Melrose Avenue.</p><p>Sweet Lady Jane built a cult following being known for its triple-berry cake, which was featured at Kourtney Kardashian's birthday party last year.</p><p>The cake is a three-layer sponge cake that is filled with whipped cream and fresh berries.</p><p>While many customers were sad to see the bakery go, others feel that the store has another reason for shutting its doors.</p><p>One customer wrote on Instagram: "I have loved your cakes for years but to blame California for your over-expansion and the woes that come with that is unfair. Where else in the country except NY can you charge $100 for a cake?</p><p>"So California and Los Angeles were good to you all these years in making your business, now it’s to blame. Sorry - It’s on you! So sorry for your employees and that they got no warning of this."</p><p>Another said: "Sorry but this is BS. Your business plan failed by opening too many locations. You make hundreds of cakes weekly at a very high cost.</p><p>"Thousands of loyal supporters for decades and you want to blame the living wage laws of California? For what you charge for your cakes you should be able to pay your staffing needs just fine.</p><p>"Maybe close a location or two or four that don’t have the clientele. But to kill your bread and butter storefront? That fails the community. Pfft."</p><p>Before the announcement, the bakery had just <a aria-label="recently renovated (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recently renovated</a> their Encino store, last month.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>The store planned to expand its Marina Del Rey and Larchmont locations and had closed its shop in West Hollywood last year for renovations, according to <a href=# aria-label="Eater Los Angeles.
