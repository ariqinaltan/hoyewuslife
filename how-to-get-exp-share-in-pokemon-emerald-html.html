Share in Pokemon Emerald</h2><p data-sourcepos=3:1-3:667>Ah, the Exp. Share. That magical little device that turns your weakling Pokemon into experience-sucking ninjas. Let's face it, trainer, we all have those Pokemon in our team that just...well, lag behind. Maybe it's your adorable but perpetually confused Spoink. Or perhaps it's your perpetually napping Slaking (because hey, we all have those days). Whatever the reason, the Exp. Share is the answer to your levelling woes. But how do you get your hands on this glorious item in Pokemon Emerald? Don't worry, aspiring Pokemon master, this guide will have you swimming in experience in no time (well, maybe not swimming, but you'll definitely be making some headway).</p><h3 data-sourcepos=5:1-5:74>The Not-So-Shady Delivery Service (But Seriously, Deliver the Letter)</h3><p data-sourcepos=7:1-7:252>There's a reason they call it the Devon Corporation. These guys are practically running Hoenn with their fancy technology and whatnot. But fear not, because their shiny new president, Mr. Stone, holds the key to Exp. Share greatness...well, kind of.</p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:16>Here's the deal:</p><li data-sourcepos=11:1-11:115><strong>Head to Dewford Town</strong>. You know, that place where geysers erupt like a Pokemon sneezed fire? Can't miss it.</li><li data-sourcepos=12:1-12:120><strong>Grab a Letter</strong>. No postage required, because who needs pesky mailmen when you have a talking Pokemon team, right?</li><li data-sourcepos=13:1-13:135><strong>Deliver the Letter</strong>. Steven, the grumpy champion-in-training dude over in Granite Cave, is your target. Play postman for a sec.</li><li data-sourcepos=14:1-15:0><strong>Return to the Devon Co. HQ in Rustboro City</strong>. Remember, with great deliveries comes great Exp. Share rewards! Mr. Stone, overcome with gratitude (or maybe just relief he doesn't have to deal with his own mail), will bestow upon you the coveted Exp. Share.</li><p data-sourcepos=16:1-16:88><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Don't lose the letter! Losing important mail is a rookie mistake, trainer.</p><h3 data-sourcepos=18:1-18:72>Lotto? More Like EXP. Share-o! (But This Option Might Take a While)</h3><p data-sourcepos=20:1-20:452>Feeling lucky, punk trainer? Well, you can try your luck at the Lilycove Department Store Lottery Corner. Here's the thing: you need to hit a <strong>three-digit match</strong> on the Lotto ID. That's some serious lottery luck required, my friend. But hey, if you're feeling adventurous (and maybe a little desperate), this could be your path to Exp. Share glory. Just remember, the odds are stacked against you, so maybe stick with the delivery service route.</p><p data-sourcepos=22:1-22:219><strong>Unless...</strong> you're the kind of trainer who thrives on chaos and loves defying the odds. In that case, go for it, wild gambler! Just don't come crying to me when you end up with a bag full of useless nuggets instead.</p><p data-sourcepos=24:1-24:491><strong>There you have it, trainers!</strong> With a little effort (or a whole lot of luck), you'll be well on your way to raising a well-balanced Pokemon team. Remember, there's no shame in giving your weaker Pokemon a little Exp. Share love. After all, a strong team is a happy team (and a happy team is a team less likely to judge you for your questionable fashion choices at the Lilycove Department Store). Now get out there and explore Hoenn, trainer! Catch 'em all, and level 'em all...efficiently!</p>2024-02-04T12:44:55.289+05:30<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWrGWtnZOdfHN8kW1maWtfnby4edOoZKCdpGKyubyMrJ%2BaqpVitq95z6iinqWfo3qmucSrmKWcXp3Brrg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
