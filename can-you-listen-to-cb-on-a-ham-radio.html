The short and quick answer to whether you can talk to CB radio with your ham radio is: <b>Yes, you can</b>. CB radios operate in the HF range on the 11m band. Ham radios can communicate in the HF range on the 10m and 12m band, both of which are pretty close to the citizen's band.</span></span><h2>Can I use a ham antenna for CB?</h2>A 10 meter ham band antenna (28-29.7 MHz) should work on CB radios (26.965-27.405 MHz), a 102" antenna is a 10 meter band antenna.<h2>Does Baofeng make a CB radio?</h2>BAOFENG UV-82 Plus 8W Ham CB Amateur Portable Two Way Radio+771 Antenna+PL2303 Programming Cable.<h2>Is CB the same as shortwave?</h2>No, they are not the same. Imho, ham radio is much better. It is just plain fun. It can use shortwave and talk all around the world.<h2>Can VHF talk to CB?</h2>CB or its close relatives fall into the HF frequency range (covering somewhere around 26 to 28 MHz, depending on country), so anything that accurately calls itself a VHF radio will not transmit (and most likely will not receive) CB.<h2>Why can't you have CB and ham radio in one radio?</h2><p></p><h2>Is CB channel 9 still monitored?</h2>"We do not routinely monitor Channel 9," he added.<h2>Do police use VHF or UHF?</h2>Police radios operate in a 700/800 MHz UHF band. This gives them a considerable amount of range which is pretty good in urban areas. The P25 radio systems give an improved range for officers.<h2>Do truckers still use CB radios 2021?</h2>For the most part, CB radios remain in use because they are the norm for truckers who have been working in the industry for the last 10 or 20+ years. While some truckers have resorted to using trucking apps on smartphones to communicate, more advanced radio systems offer a more ideal route.<h2>What is better than a CB radio?</h2>Wide-band FM modulation means clearer audio and less static. Better range than CB under most circumstances – Up to 30 miles. Able to use repeaters for even more coverage. Shorter, more powerful antenna than what CBs use.<h2>How far will a 4 watt CB transmit?</h2>Transmitter power is limited to 4 watts in the US and the EU. CB radios have a range of about 3 miles (4.8 km) to 20 miles (32 km) depending on terrain, for line of sight communication; however, various radio propagation conditions may intermittently allow communication over much greater distances.<h2>What frequency is CB on?</h2>The CB Radio spectrum is broken up into 40 channels with CB frequencies ranging from 26.965 to 27.405 MHz. Channels are generally spaced 10 KHz apart.<h2>Is the Baofeng UV 5R a CB?</h2>Baofeng UV-5R Walkie Talkie Dual Band CB HAM Radio 2 Two Way Portable Transceiver VHF UHF FM BF UV 5R Radios Handheld Stereo.<h2>How do you program a CB channel on a Baofeng UV 5R?</h2><p>How to manually program the Baofeng UV-5R from the keypad</p><li>Press [VFO/MR] and enter Frequency Mode.</li><li>Press [A/B] and choose the A Side (upper display). ...</li><li>Press [BAND] for the frequency band. ...</li><li>Disable TDR (Dual Watch/Dual Standby). ...</li><li>Enter the frequency. ...</li><li>optional - Enter the transmit CTCSS/DCS code.</li><h2>What happens if you use a ham radio without a license?</h2>Federal law generally prohibits radio broadcasts without a license issued by the FCC. Anyone found operating a radio station without FCC authorization can be subject to a variety of enforcement actions, including seizure of equipment, fines and other civil and criminal penalties.<h2>Will a 10 meter radio work as a CB?</h2>10 Meter Radios are not designed to communicate with CB Radios. Unlike a CB Radio, you need to have a license to operate a 10 Meter Radio. The reason for this is because the 10 Meter Radios are allowed to have more wattage/power output than CB Radios.<h2>Should I get a CB radio or a ham radio?</h2>Ham Radio Power vs CB Power<p>CB is capped at 4 watts of power by the FCC. Ham radio is capped at 1500 watts of power by the FCC. Ham radio is literally, potentially 375x more capable than CB. Now, if you run that much power, you are going to need a good dual battery setup and a high output alternator.</p><h2>Are CB radios coming back?</h2>Many thought citizens band radios would disappear after the 1970s, along with pet rocks and disco. But not only are they still around, they are making a comeback. CB radio sales have increased steadily during the last three years, a trend not seen since the 1970s.<h2>Can walkie-talkie pick up CB?</h2>Walkie-talkies cannot talk to CB radios. This is due to many reasons involving frequency that keep them from communicating with each other. They are similar but also very different. Keep reading to learn more about the communication barriers between walkie-talkies and CB radios.<h2>What are truckers using instead of CB radios?</h2>Several truck drivers now find themselves using trucking apps on their smartphones to communicate, like Next Trucking, for example. Some use a more evolved radio system, such as a satellite radio service like Sirius or XM, to replace their CB radio.<h2>Why do people put CB radios in their car?</h2>Using your CB could help you find an alternate route in a traffic jam, warn you of road blockages ahead, get you real-time weather reports and severe weather warnings, and get you assistance for a mechanical breakdown or medical emergency.<h2>Do truckers still use channel 19?</h2>Channel 19 is pretty much home base for long haul truckers. Line-haul drivers could be found on channels other than 19.<h2>Is it illegal to use a two way radio while driving?</h2>The short answer is yes – you may legally use a two way radio while driving, as long as this does not cause your driving to suffer in any way. The detail behind this simplified answer, and which every two way radio user should be aware of, requires a slightly fuller explanation.<h2>Can police track walkie talkie?</h2>2 way radios are difficult to trace. Two-way radios, also known as walkie-talkies, remain popular even after the advent of cell phones. Police and security forces, the armed forces, event managers, hunters and many others use them. Two-way radios are extremely difficult to trace.<h2>What frequencies can I use without a ham license?</h2>Almost all GMRS radios also support FRS frequencies, which can be used without a license. Channels 8-14 on a typical 22 channel consumer radio reserved exclusively for FRS. These channels can be used license-free, but are limited to a half watt of transmit power and will have limited range.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6rbXSrZynZaSkeqSujKilZpldna6uedGam6Kn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
