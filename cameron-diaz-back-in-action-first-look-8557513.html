Today, Netflix shared a sizzle reel for its upcoming 2024 releases, including&nbsp;Back in Action, the film that's reuniting Diaz and Jamie Foxx and tossing them away from&nbsp;Annie&nbsp;and into a heart-pounding, fast-paced action flick with a touch of family drama. 2014's Annie was the last time Diaz was in a movie (with Foxx, of course), but the two had worked together before on&nbsp;Any Given Sunday in 1999.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>, Diaz and Foxx star as Emily and Matt, respectively. They're "a pair of former spies who abandon their CIA careers to start a family together — until their cover is blown, forcing them back into the world of espionage."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Todd Owyoung/NBC via Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“What if mom and dad are criminals?” their daughter, who is played by McKenna Roberts, can be seen asking at the beginning of the clip. The fact that mom and dad get into a fight at a gas station may be a clue that they're not normal parents, they're (cool) spy parents. For anyone missing the vibe of Diaz from Charlie's Angels and its sequel Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, this is exactly the thing to scratch the itch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The production of&nbsp;Back in Action&nbsp;has been plagued with rumors of Foxx being difficult on set, but Diaz&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>previously shut down</a>&nbsp;those headlines.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I really hate all of the things that were being said about our set at the time,” she said. “You just want to scream at the top of your lungs, like, ‘What are you talking about?’"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Jamie is the best,” she added. “I love that guy so much. He’s such a special person and he’s so talented, so much fun … the hiccups that happened throughout production are the natural kinds of things that happen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Foxx was also&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>hurt during the movie's production</a>&nbsp;back in 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"We wanted to share that my father, Jamie Foxx, experienced a medical complication yesterday," his daughter Corinne&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>shared in a statement</a>&nbsp;written on behalf of the Foxx family. "Luckily, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery. We know how beloved he is and appreciate your prayers. The family asks for privacy during this time."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">People&nbsp;notes that it didn't happen on set.
