Ahead of season 7's release on November 3, the streamer announced that the delicious docu-soap would release its second-ever reunion show, where the cast will answer all the burning questions fans were left with at the end of the seventh installment. In addition to the promise of catching up with the show's cast, the special will also take a cue from Love Is Blind's recent reunions and drop at a special time. (But don't worry, it won't be live.) Read on for everything we know about the episode, from when to tune in to what will be discussed.</p><h2 id=when-will-the-season-7-reunion-air-3>When will the season 7 reunion air?</h2><p>Netflix has revealed that the reunion special will arrive on the platform at <strong>Wednesday, November 15 at 6pm PT/ 9pm ET</strong>. The specific drop time means that all Sunset fans will be able to follow along with the drama on the social media platforms of their choosing—which is half the fun of reunions.</p><p>The streaming giant dropped the news along with a first look at the cast during the special, along with the returning host, Tan France from Queer Eye. Netflix has yet to reveal when the reunion was filmed relative to the rest of season 7, but the pre-recorded show at least guarantees there won't be any tech issues à la&nbsp;Love Is Blind's reunion.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Selling Sunset Season 7 premieres tomorrow!And on November 15 at 6pm PT/9pm ET, get ready for the Selling Sunset Reunion event you WON’T want to miss, hosted by Tan France! pic.twitter.com/ertYwNmA2V<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1720108619608244565 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>November 2, 2023</a></p><h2 id=which-cast-members-will-attend-the-season-7-reunion-3>Which cast members will attend the season 7 reunion?</h2><p>In addition to the official first-look pic, several of the show's cast members confirmed their attendance by sharing behind-the-scenes photos (and outfit pics) to Instagram, including <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzKUPfQvubD/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Chrishell Stause</a>, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/p/CzKJuJsySa6/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Mary Bonnet (née Fitzgerald), and Romain Bonnet</a>.

On the day of season 7's release, Heather announced in an Instagram post that she would no longer be part of the show. "It’s bittersweet to not be a part of SS anymore," she wrote. "But I do know that good or bad I wouldn’t change the experiences I had. Let the drama begin. I’ll be no part of it. Thank you -> next."</p><p>Neither Heather nor the Selling Sunset crew has elaborated on her exit, but hopefully all will be explained during the reunion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8qFkAm7Hhjk8oZpSukhLzS-1920-80.jpeg><h2 id=will-there-be-a-39-selling-sunset-39-season-8-3>Will there be a 'Selling Sunset' season 8?</h2><p>As of November 3, Netflix has yet to give any word regarding Sunset's future.
