In February 2022, he launched his podcast, "Strange, Dark & Mysterious Stories." He told <a href=#>The Verge</a>&nbsp;that he always figured his content style would work well as a podcast, but&nbsp;he didn't know where to start.&nbsp;"I really had no idea how to scale a YouTube channel into anything else," he said. But eventually he figured it out, and the results didn't disappoint.&nbsp;As he said to&nbsp;<a href=#>Metro</a>, "I anticipated there would maybe be a lot of people interested in making the jump [from YouTube], but this has been above and beyond my expectations."</p><p dir=ltr>Steven Cohen of Cadence13 couldn't believe the momentum of MrBallen's podcast. "[It was] putting up numbers that, honestly, having come from a reasonably big network, I had never seen," he told The Verge. So, in May 2022 Cohen decided to join forces with MrBallen and help with the podcast's brand.</p><p dir=ltr>As for what's next? While they continue to take big steps with the brand, they aren't going to rush into anything.&nbsp;"Before we expand, and possibly dilute what it is we've got, we want to be very, very careful," Cohen said in The Verge.&nbsp;"We are rocking this very gently to bed every night, making sure it sleeps well, wakes up renewed and refreshed the next day."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamphaIN2g46mqZuZnKGyr7%2BMppytnZ%2BntqR50aKqnmWkpHq1tMRmq6ioXaSzbsXOrquumpVisaK%2By6KloKtdmsWxuMCipZ6cXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
