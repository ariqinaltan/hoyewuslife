Nevertheless, some new statements made by him in a studio video that surfaced online have fans speculating on the idea that they're still committed to one another. Moreover, in this clip, the BMF star says that his girlfriend is pregnant when answering a question about whether he had kids. While it's unclear whether he and the R&B singer are fully together right now, the last thing we heard from them were breakup rumors following a reencounter... following a breakup. Needless to say, take this with a grain of salt.</p><p>However, one thing that they did make at least somewhat of an effort to clarify is regarding these <a href=# rel>pregnancy rumors</a> themselves. They swirled out of control at one point earlier in the fall, which led to some posts and jabs about the situation. For example, Summer Walker shared on Twitter a design of a T-shirt that asked, "Guess how many months I am for a cash prize! To claim reward call: 1-800-MIND-YO-BUSINESS." You can't blame her for wanting to clap back at the haters with her great sense of humor, even if she is really not up for answering anything.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=# rel>Summer Walker's Hourglass Figure Is Curvier Than Ever In Tight Denim Dress: Video</a></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-meech-says-his-girl-s-pregnant-does-he-mean-summer-walker>Lil Meech Says His Girl's Pregnant; Does He Mean Summer Walker?</h2></span><p>Of course, fans have a wide array of opinions on this matter, given just how tumultuous Summer Walker and Lil Meech's timeline has been so far.
