Once a permanent is on the battlefield, it stays there until it’s destroyed, exiled, sacrificed, or otherwise removed according to the game rules.</p><h3>Does a sorcery count as a permanent?</h3><p>No, a sorcery is not considered a permanent in MTG.

They can interact with other cards and permanents and remain on the battlefield until they are destroyed, exiled, sacrificed, or otherwise removed.</p><h3>What is not a permanent in magic?</h3><p>In Magic: The Gathering, not all cards are considered permanents. Instant and sorcery cards, for example, are not permanents. Only cards that can be put onto the battlefield, such as artifacts, creatures, enchantments, lands, and planeswalker cards, are considered permanents.</p><h3>Is a battle a permanent MTG?</h3><p>Yes, a battle is considered a permanent MTG when it is on the battlefield.

Each instance of Deathtouch still applies, meaning that any creature that is dealt damage by a creature with Deathtouch is destroyed, regardless of the damage dealt.</p><h3>Is a land a colored permanent?</h3><p>No, lands are not colored permanents by default. Lands usually do not have mana costs or colored mana symbols in their cards, so they do not have an inherent color. However, lands with specific abilities or characteristics, such as those that generate colored mana or have specific mana costs, can have a color.</p><h3>Is a aura a permanent?</h3><p>Yes, auras are considered permanents in MTG.
