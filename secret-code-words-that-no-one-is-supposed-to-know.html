Bet you never knew Mickey could be so sneaky, huh? Some <a href=#>people have noticed</a> this euphemism in action, but according to <a href=#>Disney Dining</a>, it's mainly employed for diplomatic purposes rather than gossip: Disneyland workers are forbidden from using insulting language due to all the kids around, so calling the jerks "treasured guests" is a nice way to warn coworkers.</p><p>This isn't the only code word you'll hear at the world's most colorful playground, though. For example, people who urinate in the swimming pool activate a "Code Winnie," hardy har har. (There's no mention of a "Code Pooh," so hopefully that isn't a frequent occurrence.) Broken rides are Code 101s, and fixed rides are Code 102s. There's also the so-called "White Powder Alert," but don't worry, it's not about cocaine. Rather, it refers to when people attempt to spread a loved one's ashes on the park grounds, which (like it or not) is illegal without Disneyland's permission. And honestly, when Grandpa Robbie said he wanted his ashes sprinkled from the top of the Matterhorn, he probably meant the real one in the Swiss Alps, not the roller coaster imitation in Anaheim.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lGlna2tfqLKkvsStZJynlJp6uLvRnapmrJiWwW66zmamp51dnsBuv9Spp6irlZl6tbuMpKWor18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
