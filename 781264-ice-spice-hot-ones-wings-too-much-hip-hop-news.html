For instance, she recently linked with Sean Evans for an episode of Hot Ones. Hot Ones is one of those shows that a ton of celebrities will do, regardless of their domain. After all, you get to have an interesting conversation, all while eating some delicious hot wings. The most entertaining part of the show, however, is whether or not the guest is able to finish all of their wings. Unfortunately, for Ice Spice, she was one of the victims of the challenge.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-on-hot-ones>Ice Spice On "Hot Ones"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the clip above, you can see that one of the wings had her shaking a bit. Moreover, tears were welling in her eyes, and she could barely focus on the interview. Sean Evans tried to guide her through it, but it proved to be too tough of a task. In fact, she ended up tapping out prior to the last wing. She didn't want to put herself through any more torture, and you can't blame her. Maybe in the future, she can go back on and try all over again.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you thought of the latest Ice Spice appearance on Hot Ones.
