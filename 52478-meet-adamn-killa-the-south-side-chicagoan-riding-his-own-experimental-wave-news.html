The 19-year-old pink-dreaded Chicagoan purveys a somewhat melancholy brand of motivational rap. Compared to his competition, his quick flexes are humble, but due to his backstory, that makes them all the more inspirational. He doesn't have to remind listeners where he's from, as his monotone bears the weight of the cold streets of the South Side of Chicago.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Though his energy doesn't sway too much, Adamn fluctuates between quicker, drill-inspired flows or drawn out bursts of melodic rapping. In each case, the mumble effect only serves to amplify the song's resonance. What's most special about his voice is its ability to hold steady amid an eclectic range of productions, whether it be trap, warped European club sounds, or bass-heavy ambient beats from mysterious SoundCloud producers, such as Blank Body, with whom he released October 2015's&nbsp;<strong>Libra Season</strong>,&nbsp;which got him heavy exposure on array of taste-making blogs. He's since joined forces with two experimental beat-making crews, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Shlohmo</a>'s WeDidIt and Brodinski's Bromance, both which have come into the game with a knowledge of hip-hop as well as experience with a world of other sounds.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Adamn has also made waves across the pond and, specifically, in Sweden, as the country's leading rap star, Yung Lean, discovered his early SoundCloud work. The pair has since collaborated multiple times, and the Sad Boy leader invited Adamn to open on his "Warlord" world tour earlier this year. Lean guests on the Shlohmo-produced "Ten," which stands as arguably Adamn's biggest hit. The pair went to Amsterdam for the mesmerizing video, in which they venture from a demolition lot to a field of tulips with a giant yellow snake.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The young equestrian's recent work includes the "Saddler" video -- which stays true to its title -- as well as his&nbsp;<strong>Mr 650&nbsp;</strong>mixtape, executive produced by North Carolina heavy-hitter DP Beats. We spoke to Adamn when he was in the studio working with WeDidIt's Ryan Hemsworth on their new collaborative single, "Commas," which dropped last month.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">You may recognize Adamn from his signature ad-lib -- his own name delivered with a hiccup. Now it's time to meet the Killa himself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>So you’re out in L.A. right now working on a song with Ryan Hemsworth?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Yeah, we shooting a video for it right now.&nbsp;</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>How'd you first get affiliated with the WeDidIt crew and interested in producers like Shlohmo and Hemsworth?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Ryan is good friends with Will [Hoopes, his manager], and I had met him a couple times. We went to the studio with him in Atlanta, too. And I ran into Shlohmo at the at the airport one time. We went to the studio with Shlohmo when I was on one of my first trips out here.
