Stronger in its harrowing, and sometimes hilarious, first part than in its rather undramatic conclusion, this impressive first feature nonetheless highlights the talents of a comedian who’s not afraid to look danger in the face and laugh about it. With <span data-scayt_word=Gaumont data-scaytid=15>Gaumont</span> releasing on home turf, the film should see a decent turnout on big and small screens, with festival play a more likely possibility abroad.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Born in Iran and raised in France, <span data-scayt_word=Kheiron data-scaytid=16>Kheiron</span> (last name: <span data-scayt_word=Tabib data-scaytid=19>Tabib</span>) – known locally through a series of one-man shows and TV appearances – tells the story of his father, <span data-scayt_word=Hibat data-scaytid=20>Hibat</span> (played by the director), and mother, <span data-scayt_word=Fereshteh data-scaytid=21>Fereshteh</span> (Leila <span data-scayt_word=Bekhti data-scaytid=17>Bekhti</span> from A Prophet), two lovebirds forced to flee their homeland after the tumultuous events of the Iranian Revolution, eventually settling in the rough Paris <span data-scayt_word=banlieue data-scaytid=23>banlieue</span> of <span data-scayt_word=Pierrefitte-sur-Seine data-scaytid=27>Pierrefitte-sur-Seine</span>.</p><p><span class="lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase lrv-u-font-family-accent lrv-u-font-weight-bold lrv-u-color-brand-primary lrv-u-font-size-16 lrv-u-display-block">The Bottom Line</span> <span class="c-span u-font-size-22@tablet u-font-style-italic lrv-u-font-family-secondary">A clever autobiographical dramedy that transforms trauma into humor.</span></p><p><b>Release date:</b> Nov 11, 2015</p><span></span><p>The film kicks off by revealing how the humbly raised <span data-scayt_word=Hibat data-scaytid=24>Hibat</span> grew into a fervent opposer of the Shah (French comic <span data-scayt_word=Alexandre data-scaytid=30>Alexandre</span> <span data-scayt_word=Astier data-scaytid=31>Astier</span>), joining a Communist resistance that would land him in prison for over seven years. After lengthy periods of torture and solitary confinement, <span data-scayt_word=Hibat data-scaytid=25>Hibat</span> was finally released around the time of the 1979 uprising. He soon fell in love with the headstrong nurse <span data-scayt_word=Fereshteh data-scaytid=26>Fereshteh</span>, but their honeymoon was cut short by the rise of an Islamist dictatorship under the Ayatollah Khomeini.</p><p>Despite the traumatic events unfolding, <span data-scayt_word=Kheiron data-scaytid=33>Kheiron</span> manages to infuse these early sequences with plenty of humor, depicting <span data-scayt_word=Hibat data-scaytid=34>Hibat</span> and his merry dissenters as a quick-witted gang willing to risk their lives in the name of freedom. There are arrests, deaths and, eventually, a clandestine crossing through the mountains into Turkey, yet the film never grows overtly heavy, finding ways to land jokes during some fairly tough moments. And unlike many French farces, where the emphasis is often on nonstop banter or slapstick gags, All Three of Us plays out like a situational comedy a <span data-scayt_word=l’americaine data-scaytid=38>l’americaine</span>, with <span data-scayt_word=Kheiron data-scaytid=37>Kheiron</span> mining his parents’ story for laughs without betraying their rebellious spirit.</p><p>When the couple finally makes safely to France, they continue to be active in anti-Khomeini protests. After years of study and hard work, they land community service jobs in the mixed-race neighborhood where they settle north of Paris. Although intriguing on a personal level, these events lack the narrative force of the film’s first half, even if <span data-scayt_word=Kheiron data-scaytid=40>Kheiron</span> offers some astute observations about the multicultural melting pot where he grew up – a place where ethnicities and crime often collided. But a way too gushy conclusion feels more like a love letter to mommy and daddy than a suitable finale, while archive photos in the closing credits underline how this was all a true story.</p><p>Tech credits are above par for a French comedy, with DP Jean-Francois <span data-scayt_word=Hensgens data-scaytid=42>Hensgens</span> (Our Children) avoiding your typically <span data-scayt_word=overlit data-scaytid=43>overlit</span> medium shots and making the most of the breathtaking Iranian locations (which were actually lensed in Morocco). Soundtrack includes the opening movement from Phillip Glass’s Glassworks, used in a rather artfully crafted montage where Kheiron’s own birth is cross-cut with the deadly affairs that would oblige his parents to abandon their country for good. &nbsp;</p><p>Production companies: Adama Pictures, Gaumont, M6<br>Cast: Kheiron, <a href=# id=auto-tag_leila-bekhti data-tag=leila-bekhti>Leila Bekhti</a>, Gerard Darmon, Zabou Breitman, Alexandre Astier<br>Director, screenwriter: Kheiron<br>Director of photography: Jean-Francois Hensgens<br>Production designer: Stanislas Reydellet<br>Costume designer: Karen Muller-Serreau<br>Editor: Anny Danche<br>Casting director: Richard Rousseau<br>Sales agent: Gaumont</p><p>No rating, 102 minutes</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSrnaaesri%2FjpqjpWWknb%2BmsYyuqmamn6rAbsDRqKCsZWhpfXN8k2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
