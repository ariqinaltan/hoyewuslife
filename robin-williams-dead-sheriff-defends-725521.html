He described in detail how Williams carried out the suicide and the condition of the body. Some people criticized the level of detail, and experts in suicide prevention said the information could influence those considering suicide to try the same thing.</p><p>“Having that amount of detail is not helpful” said Lyn Morris, vp clinical operations at Didi Hirsch Mental Health Services, which runs the main suicide prevention hotline in Southern California. “The contagion effect is real, and it’s worrisome.”</p><p>Boyd said the sheriff’s office is discussing with the county’s attorney possible exemptions to the public records act that would allow it to withhold the 911 call received from Williams’ home and the fire dispatch tapes. But Boyd said the agency would likely have to release them within ten days, as required by law.</p><p>Free speech groups defended the disclosures as appropriate and said the law enforcement agency was responding to a crush of requests for information required to be disclosed.</p><p>“Coroners are not required to provide details by press conference,” said <strong>Terry Francke</strong>, head of open government group Californians Aware. But he said the Marin County Sheriff’s Department chose to disseminate as much information as quickly as possible at one time rather than leak piecemeal. Some three dozen television cameras and twice as many reporters from around the globe crowded the news conference outside the sheriff’s offices Tuesday morning.</p><p>“While the impact of the details on some people’s mourning of Mr. Williams’ passing may have been jarring, keeping what was known under wraps would have added needless speculation if not suspicion to the general shock,” Francke said.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofLO7waKlZq%2BZobmqrcysZJ2dkZl6tLTEq6Cfnl2ZsqexzZ2qZm9iaoJzfY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
