And whether you're comfortable visiting your stylist at the salon or want ideas on how to style your hair at home, this season's hair trends have you covered.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Instagram/@priyankachopra/@yarashahidi</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a complete breakdown on the season's most popular haircuts and styles, we turned to the professionals, including <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Naeemah Lafond</a>, amika global artistic director, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>David Lopez</a>, celebrity hairstylist and T3 stylist ambassador, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>Laura Polko</a>, Nature Lab.

The Mullet</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Mike Coppola/FilmMagic/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Forget every stereotype you associate with the mullet. The 2021 version of the cut is incredibly cool. "Mullets have taken on a less boxy and more feminine approach these days," says LaFond. "The softer shape has made the notorious classic a more approachable trend that appeals to all textures."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">LaFond notes that the mullet can be adapted for a number of hair textures, from tightly-coiled curls to straight strands for an effortless vibe. "I use the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amika Un.Done Volume and Matte Texture Spray</a> for airiness and wispy pieces to further add to the easy feel of the look," she adds.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-2-bangs-bangs-and-more-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>2. Bangs, Bangs, and More Bangs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"More and more people are wanting to experiment with their hair without losing length, and fringe is a great first step," says Lopez. From blunt to wispy, there are a number of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bang styles</a> to choose from, but Priyanka's piece-y, textured fringe is a good gateway into the bangs lifestyle.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When you're at the salon, Lopez suggests asking your stylist to soften the bangs so they grow out more naturally.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-3-curtain-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>3. Curtain Bangs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Speaking of bangs, Polko predicts <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>curtain bangs</a> will continue to be popular this spring. "It's just a nice face frame without a full blunt bang," she says. "They're popular because they're not a full commitment since they can be tucked behind your ear without clipping off."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When styling curtain bangs, Polko likes to run a mix of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nature Lab. Tokyo's Perfect Repair Leave-in Treatment</a> along with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Perfect Volume Texture Mist</a> through them when they're damp, then blow dry straight with a round brush. "Shake down with your hands and let it part down the middle naturally," she suggests.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-4-the-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>4. The Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Steve Granitz/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Long live the bob. The <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>classic chin-length cut</a> continues to be popular simply because it looks amazing across hair textures. "Blunt bobs and blunt ends are having quite the moment right now," says LaFond. "They were trending before with the rise of the lob, but now not only is it cute, it's super practical. The sharp edged cuts are helping manage the long stretches of time people are going without being able to see a professional stylist."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The stylist suggests prepping hair with a heat protectant like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>amika's Blockade Heat Defense Serum</a> before heat styling to keep it healthy and strong.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-5-center-parts></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>5. Center Parts</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Gen Z on TikTok, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>center parts are a symbol of "youth.</a>" But let's be real: how you part your hair is based on personal preference. However, the center part is trending because it's a simple way to transform an existing haircut into an entirely new style. Lopez says it'll give a new cut a fresh, easy look, too.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When blow-drying your hair, "use the concentrator on your dryer to gently smooth your center part into a head hugging look that feels right out of a fashion magazine," Lopez recommends. "Finish with the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>T3 Lucea ID Flat</a> Iron for extra shine and sleekness."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-6-round-and-textured></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>6. Round and Textured</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Your natural hair texture is always in style, but this spring is all about really showing off your curls and coils. "As natural hair takes the main stage, we're seeing rounder, fuller shapes that really celebrate our hair's natural texture and shape," says Lopez.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For extra shine, Lopez likes finishing things off with a spritz of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Kenra Professional Dry Oil Conditioning Mist</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-7-cropped-and-colorful></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>7. Cropped and Colorful</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"What's more drastic than a shorter length and bold hair color?" asks Lopez. After seeing Demi Lovato's pastel pink choppy pixie, you'd have to agree.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"For those ready to fully experiment this is a great time to take the creative plunge," Lopez says. "Haircut maintenance will be key here so make sure to see your stylist as often as you can to keep up the shape."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-8-the-90s-flip></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>8. The '90s Flip</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many of us have been finding comfort in nostalgia to help get us through the pandemic. Along with bingeing '90s TV shows like Sister, Sister and Moesha on Netflix, the decade's beauty trends are making a comeback, too. Enter flipped ends.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_64-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"This is super simple to do with any heat tool, whether it be a blowdryer, curling iron or flatiron," Polko shares. "It's also a good way to hide dead ends, which is a reason I think people like it." The stylist likes prepping hair with a shine-boosting mist like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Nature Lab. Tokyo's Perfect Shine Oil Mist</a> so the ends are glossy and won't separate before taking a hot tool to your hair.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qgq2ejpb%2BqusZmn5qhopjCtXnTq5ynnKNif3F%2BkA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
