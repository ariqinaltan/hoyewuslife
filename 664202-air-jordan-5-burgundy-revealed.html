We say this due to the fact there have been a lot of new releases for this shoe. Overall, this is mostly because the sneaker celebrated a 30th birthday in 2020. Consequently, Jumpman wanted to come out with as many retros as humanly possible. Additionally, they made sure to drop a lot of dope new colorways as well. In the end, it was a great stretch for the sneaker, and it seems like the hype is continuing.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Although Jumpman isn't treating the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel="nofollow noopener">Air Jordan</a> 5 like it is 2020 again, we are still seeing some solid teasers hit the market. Over these past couple of months, one shoe that people have been talking <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">about is the Air Jordan 5 "Burgundy."</a> This is a sneaker that first came out back in 2006.
