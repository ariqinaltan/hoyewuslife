Do you have any plans to <a href=#>launch more products</a>?</strong></p><p><strong>Jamie:</strong> I know you want to take this one. She's much more excited.</p><p><strong>Beth:</strong> I want to show you this. I'm so excited. We're about to launch these [pillows] for Valentine's Day. So the <a href=#>"basic Caucasian sex" mugs</a>, Jamie made those, and so those really took off. People love them.</p><p><strong>Jamie:</strong> It was such a hit, it blows my mind.</p><p><strong>Beth:</strong> So we've got pillows that are about to come out for your bed and on the back it says, "bam, bam, done," for the definition of basic Caucasian sex.</p><p><strong>Jamie:</strong> You can send a message. You may not be sure what the message is you're sending, but at least you know you're sending a message.</p><p><strong>Beth:</strong> It's such a funny gag gift. Imagine if your boyfriend, like the first time you ever went to his house ... and you're looking through his house and you go into his bedroom and you see these pillows sitting on his bed. What would be your first thoughts if you saw that?</p><p><strong>Jamie:</strong> For sure, conversation starter.</p><p><strong>Beth:</strong> Yeah, conversation piece. That's what it's about. We're just trying to have some fun with it.</p><p><strong>So can we expect some other products down the line?</strong></p><p><strong>Beth:</strong> I want to play ... I'm a very intricate, like, eccentric person. And so there's a lot of different lifestyle items for your household I think I'm going to start working on. So hopefully in the future, everybody will have those really cool ... Can I tell you one of my ideas? Should I tell [them] one of my ideas that I want to do?</p><p><strong>Jamie:</strong> I think so.</p><p><strong>Beth:</strong> Okay, so you know how in your house, we all have our novelty items and things like that, that you don't quite want everybody to see, but you're maybe a little bit proud of them? So I want to create a "no-no box" for everyone. So you can have a really cute box for your goodies, whatever you want to put in there, like your sex toys. If you want to put other novelty, fancy items you don't want people to see in your house. But it's just a fun conversation piece. You're like, "Oh, my no-no box? Oh yeah, that's for me." So I want to do little things like that, [that] I think are going to be really funny. So I don't know what might come out of my little creative head coming up.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxiaIV1e8yaqauhlZl6osCMn6Crq6RiwKqzx62qZpqVqbVurc2dZKOZnZ6ybrvNZpqepJWXerS8zq2roqaXYravedKapa2ZXZeus67Aq5hmnJWWuaq6xmauoqyYYsGzu8ulqmaZnpl6rq3KoqWgZaSdsqq%2BjKaYq6qZlrSmedaoqaRlla2wrcHSoq2eZZmjwaa%2B1aKcsGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
