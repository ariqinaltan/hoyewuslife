According to Deal, Usher was allegedly a victim of grooming by Diddy, sparking controversy within the music industry. Deal expressed bewilderment over Usher's apparent praise for Diddy during an appearance on Shannon Sharpe's Club Shay Shay podcast, given their tumultuous history. "I know and people know that was around in that time that Puff [Daddy] and Usher did have a situation," Deal stated. "And that situation led Usher to the hospital. Now, I'll let Usher explain that to y'all. I'll let Usher tell that story. But how dare you say a man that groomed you, you gonna give him a pass. Bruh, you know I know."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Usher's connection with Diddy dates back to his teenage years when he lived with the hip-hop mogul for a year. Deal believed that Usher should publicly address Diddy's alleged misconduct. To illustrate his point, Deal recounted an uncomfortable incident he allegedly witnessed. "Remember Usher, we was at the Swiss√¥tel," Deal recalled. "Puff had Kim [Porter] in the room, had one of Keith Sweat's baby mothers in the big room outside the master bedroom. He came outside in his robe. He came outside in his robe, she gave him f****** right there. His back was turned to me."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-gene-deal-accuses-diddy>Gene Deal Accuses Diddy</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, it's essential to approach these claims with caution, as they remain allegations until proven otherwise. Nevertheless, they serve as a reminder of the complexities and potential pitfalls of the entertainment world. Furthermore, there are now several lawsuits and allegations against Diddy since <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Cassie</a> filed a large lawsuit against him.
