So, as some of you (read: me) might be wondering: Who is this very, very attractive actor dating? Speaking of—the degree of his attractiveness has actually been a bit controversial, given how Menzies plays&nbsp;the most evil character on Earth&nbsp;thanks to&nbsp;Outlander&nbsp;(ever heard of Black Jack Randall? Go Google it, I'll wait).</p><p>But I'm officially a Menzies fan, even before he graced us with his presence on&nbsp;The Crown. He also played the dumb-but-lovable Edmure Tully, who somehow, unbelievably, makes it to the end of&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-auto-tag-linker=true data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/tag/game-of-thrones/>Game of Thrones</a>&nbsp;unscathed. Menzies has, for the most, kept his private life successfully under wraps, but let's investigate what we do know.</p><p>The reason why Menzies so tight-lipped about his personal life likely dates back to 2006. That's when Menzies found himself in a bit of controversy—<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/oct/03/kristin-scott-thomas-electra-old-vic referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>he started dating Kristin Scott Thomas</a>&nbsp;while the two were starring in a London production of&nbsp;As You Desire Me. The timing isn't exactly known, but rumor has it that she started a relationship with Menzies while still married to François Olivennes, and Scott Thomas and Menzies' relationship was the cause of her split and subsequent divorce.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/btJGLz77zYzKUjR56pCCmL-1920-80.jpg><p>Menzies and Scott Thomas aren't together anymore...and we basically haven't heard a thing about Menzies' personal life ever sense.&nbsp;</p><p>Obviously, this could also be a case of Menzies just being that good at hiding his private life—believe it or not, if paparazzi photographers aren't parked outside your house, it's actually not&nbsp;as&nbsp;hard as it sounds. Menzies is on&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/tobiasmenzies referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Twitter</a>, but (no surprise) doesn't really post about his private life, choosing instead to highlight causes he supports.
