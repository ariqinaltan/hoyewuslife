Stealing sh*t, is that your job?” the officer interjects before the video cuts off.</p><p>The clip was picked up on Reddit and Facebook community pages, where viewers largely praised the officer for her “no-nonsense” interaction with the man.</p><p>“I think Australians need a little more of this tough love rather than the cuddles and cotton wool that everybody expects these days,” wrote one man.</p><p>“Say it how it is! It’s how it should be, none of this walking on egg shells around people because they might get offended. Good on her,” agreed another.</p><p>Some viewers even hailed the woman a “hero” and “absolute legend”.</p><p>However, a few were critical of her “unprofessional” behaviour.</p><p>One woman said she hoped the officer copped a fine for swearing in public, but others quickly came to the officer’s defence.</p><p>“I’ll pay her fine if she does, what a champion,” one said.</p><p>NSW Police said they were aware of the footage and conducting enquiries.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>In a statement, police said officers were called to Hunter Street in relation to an alleged stealing offence.</p><p>“Police spoke with and arrested a 31-year-old man for an outstanding arrest warrant for property offences,” police said.</p><p>“He remains remanded in custody and is next due to appear at Cessnock Local Court on Wednesday March 23.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7zZqroqeelrlwutKwZJqbpGS7sLrOp6qepqOaeqexzJqjnmWTpL1us86eqmaumaeurXnFqKlmnailuabAyK%2BcpZmUmrtuv8%2BrmLJlkal6orjLnp6enF2ptaqxxWilnq%2BjYsC1u9GyZmttYGiAen6Xm2pym5JosKOxkJ1sa5uSaoZ2sI%2Bam51p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
