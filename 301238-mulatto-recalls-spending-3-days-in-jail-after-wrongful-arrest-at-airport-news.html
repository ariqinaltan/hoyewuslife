She asked them what they wanted and Mulatto was told that she has a warrant. She was placed in a cell at the airport's holding area for hours before being transferred to the county jail. When Big Latto appeared before a judge, she was told that she didn't have a warrant and should be released. However, she wasn't let go for another 24 hours because the computer system was apparently not working.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The rapper added that while her friends were in the DR, the first thing she did after&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">her three-day jail stint</a> was she made her way to the studio.
