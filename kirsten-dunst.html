The superhero movie took the record for the biggest debut ever when it netted $114 million in its first three days and propelled the actress into worldwide stardom.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p id=eIVuiZVxAM data-wc=86>Born on April 30, 1982, in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, USA, Kirsten is a seasoned performer. She began modeling at age three and by the time she was 12 had appeared in more than 100 commercials. After her parents' separation, Kirsten moved with her mother, Inez, a former art gallery owner, and younger brother Christian to Los Angeles in 1993. A year later <i>The Addams Family</i> actress Christina Ricci starred opposite <a aria-label="Biography of Brad Pitt" class=hm-link href=#>Brad Pitt</a> and <a aria-label="Biography of Tom Cruise" class=hm-link href=#>Tom Cruise</a> in the hit <i>Interview With The Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles</i>.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/593ec293fc2e-gettyimages-1246470620.jpg><p id=eLwheMcA9W5 data-wc=120>Her stunning performance as an eternally youthful vampiress won rave reviews and earned her a Golden Globe nomination and the MTV Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. Kirsten had arrived. She followed <i>Vampire</i> up with a string of hit movies including 1994's <i>Little Women</i>, <i>Jumanji</i> in the following year, and <i>Small Soldiers</i> in 1998. She also made appearances on TV, most notably with a recurring role in <i>ER.</i> By the end of the decade the actress was again winning rave notices for her role as Lux Lisbon in Sofia Coppola's <i>The Virgin Suicides</i> and a year later confirmed her status as a Hollywood player with the lead in the comedy <i>Bring It On.</i> Her <i>Spider-Man</i> success would only add to that.</p><h2><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p id=eWmZONLHwDg data-wc=45>In July 2022 Kirsten<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;tied the knot with her longtime partner</a>, Jesse Plemons, after six years together. The news was originally reported by Page Six who said that the couple had quietly got married last weekend at the <strong>GoldenEye luxury resort near Ocho Rios, Jamaica.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/048dff453a31-gettyimages-1491751189.jpg><p id=emsz-OhhbuY data-wc=107>It was a long time coming for the pair who met while filming Fargo. Kirsten has previously admitted that they already call themselves "<strong>husband and wife,"</strong> and they <a class=hm-link href=#>share two sons</a>, Ennis Howard, four, and 14-month-old James Robert. &nbsp;We have to get married at this point," she told The Los Angeles Times&nbsp;as she explained how the COVID-19 pandemic altered their plans. <strong>"It's ridiculous. We just haven't planned a wedding.&nbsp;</strong>I didn't want to be pregnant, get married, have a party and not be able to have fun with everybody." &nbsp;Kirsten and Jesse began dating in 2016 when working on the second season of the FX series.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9tbl%2BgtrO%2F056lZpylo8C1ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
