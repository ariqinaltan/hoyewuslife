The bride momentarily got cold feet, forcing Colbert to run backstage and give her a bridesmaid-esque pep talk.</p><p>“Listen, if Mike is not right for you, we will blow out of here and go get tattoos, just say the word,” the host told her, leading her to reveal that she’s really nervous about getting married on TV.</p><p>With that, Colbert started to get choked up, channeling his inner host-zilla: “Don’t you ruin this for me, this is my special day, OK?! I have been dieting for like 15 minutes. … You’re gonna be fine, you’re gonna be great, but it doesn’t matter because everyone’s going to be looking at me, OK?”</p><p>Le ultimately agreed to go forward with the ceremony and Colbert married the couple&nbsp;on his show.</p><p>The wedding also featured special appearances from <strong>Mandy Patinkin</strong>, who offered a “nondenominational Jewish blessing” for the couple, and <strong>Audra McDonald</strong>, who performed a ballad version of <strong>Billy Idol</strong>‘s “White Wedding” for the couple’s first dance, a comedically inappropriate choice.</p><p>Colbert even got national park icon Smokey the Bear to stand in for the best man, who was unavailable to attend.</p><p>Watch the full wedding celebration below.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOrKueqJiau26vzqWZnqqkYrqivtGinKxlk6TCsbjEZp2oqpOasW6Ck2xqcXBf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
