An additional count of indecent assault was added mid-trial, but all four indecent assault charges were later dropped due to a “legal technicality.” However, the most serious, involving penetrative sexual activity without consent, remains and carries with it a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Spacey has denied all the charges, describing two of the sexual encounters as consensual and a third as a “clumsy pass,” for which he claimed he had later attempted to apologize. The fourth encounter he denied entirely.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Over the course of the last month, the jury has heard how Spacey was a “sexual bully” who took pleasure in making his victims of violence feel “powerless and uncomfortable.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Spacey’s defense, led by his lawyer Patrick Gibbs KC, has focused on questioning the truthfulness of the accusers. In his closing remarks last week, he said there were “three liars in this case,” adding that the “problem” with the fourth complainant’s evidence is that he “wasn’t exactly sober as he describes it —&nbsp;but nobody was.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKyx1aKlZquglrCmxYytqaKZnGK3tr7YZqmerJmnsrR5w56jopqVp661sYyvnKucmZjBbn2RbGxubGNsgnR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
