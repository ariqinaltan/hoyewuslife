The two men restrained the actor until police arrived.</p><p>Less than a month later, Dean tried to steal a man’s luxury car while wielding a wine bottle as a weapon.</p><p>The agreed facts reveal he approached the owner of an Audi A5 as he was sitting in his car in Botany, in Sydney’s south, on the evening of May 23.</p><p>“Get the f*** out of the car c*** and give me your f***ing keys,” the former child star demanded.</p><p>When the victim told him to “f*** off”, the agreed facts state Dean grabbed a full wine bottle out of his satchel and swung it towards the car owner, who leant back to avoid being hit.</p><p>The man agreed to hand over the keys but then kicked the actor in the face and the chest, causing him to abandon the carjacking attempt.</p><p>The violent incidents both occurred while Dean was serving a good behaviour bond for a previous matter of violence, the court was told.</p><p>The documents reveal the 26-year-old had been convicted last year for grabbing the arm of a schoolmate’s dad and demanding he pay his son’s $300 debt.</p><p>His lawyer Phoebe MacDougall told the court on Monday Dean didn’t dispute the facts of the offences.</p><p>“He largely doesn’t remember the events, given the drugs he was on at the time, being meth and alcohol,” she said.</p><p>Ms MacDougall explained the child actor had become addicted to illicit drugs following a traumatic event at school which “significantly altered his personality during his formative years”.</p><p>In a statement provided to NCA NewsWire, Dean explained he “resorted to drugs to cope with strong emotions” following the disturbing occurrence at school.</p><p>“Not only dealing with that, but I was also living on the streets, with the shame of knowing I was recognised because of my time as an actor on TV,” he said.</p><p>Despite this, the actor said he was able to “get a hold of (his) substance abuse issues” and finish school because he was “forming (his) own identity outside Home and Away”.</p><p>“Mr Dean, outside his addictions, is a very charismatic and smart young man,” Ms MacDougall told the court.</p><p>She said he was very encouraged by the prospect of engaging in rehabilitation and had tried to enrol himself in a custodial program.</p><p>The court heard the 26-year-old has been diagnosed with substance abuse disorder, depressive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p><p>Magistrate Robert Williams acknowledged the actor needed “quite substantial treatment” for his addictions, mental health, and his management of stress and anger.</p><p>However, he highlighted the previous matters of violence on Dean’s criminal record.</p><p>The magistrate accepted none of the four victims were injured in the attacks, but said the “serious offences” would have nonetheless caused the victims to fear for their safety.</p><p>“The court needs to consider the safety of the community,” he said.</p><p>He sentenced Dean to 20 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of one year.</p><p>“I want to apologise to the many people I have hurt and to my mother who has stood by me,” Dean said in a statement to NCA NewsWire.</p><p>The child actor maintained his time on hit soap operas Home and Away had been a “positive experience” but admitted he continues to struggle with the fallout of fame.</p><p>“Ten years on, when even the character has been replaced by multiple actors, I am trying my best to overcome the challenges I have outside of the show,” he said.</p><p>“I wish nothing more than to be afforded the opportunity to do so without the scrutiny of the public and the media.”</p><p>It’s been a long time in the limelight for Dean, who rose to prominence when he was only 10 years old.</p><p>He got his big break in the role of VJ, the on-screen son of longtime Home and Away cast member Ada Nicodemou.</p><p>Dean starred on the Channel 7 show between 2007 and 2010, and was nominated for Best Young Actor at the 2008 and 2009 Inside Soap Awards.</p><p>He will be eligible for release from prison in May 2024.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmTBs7vUm6OenF2dvK6xjJqlnWWRrK66edKtmKurXZm%2FtrPFrpylpJWZeqW71qedmqScYrK5vM6snJ1nnprEtHnSraarsV9nsKJ9wHBpmptpbIGmsZVpZ2meaGiyeYGSnmqdmmJtrw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
