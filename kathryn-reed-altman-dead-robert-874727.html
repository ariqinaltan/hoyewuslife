She was 91.</p><p>Altman died Wednesday of a heart attack at her home in Santa Monica, publicist Mike Kaplan announced. Her last public appearance came just six days earlier at a <span data-scayt_word=35th data-scaytid=1>35th</span> anniversary showing of her husband’s 1971 classic McCabe & Mrs. Miller.</p><p>Actor Keith <span data-scayt_word=Carradine data-scaytid=2>Carradine</span>, who starred in the film and attended the event, described her “as sharp as ever.”</p><p>A former showgirl with the musical troupe the Earl Carroll Vanities, she met Altman in 1959 when she was working as an extra on an episode of the syndicated&nbsp;TV show Whirlybirds that he was directing. They married that year and were together — with Kathryn serving as a welcoming presence on her husband’s movie sets — until his death in 2006 at age 81.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Altman was nominated for seven Academy Awards and received an honorary Oscar in 2006 “for a career that has repeatedly reinvented the art form and inspired filmmakers and audiences alike.”</p><p>For the past decade, his widow attended major Altman retrospectives at the Museum of Modern Art, the UCLA Film & Television Archive and at festivals throughout the world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 2014, she and critic&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Giulia data-scaytid=4>Giulia</span>&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=D’Agnolo data-scaytid=5>D’Agnolo</span>&nbsp;<span data-scayt_word=Vallan data-scaytid=6>Vallan</span>&nbsp;published a scrapbook memoir titled Altman&nbsp;and served as the narrative thread in a feature-length documentary of the same name directed by Ron Mann.</p><p>“Our hearts are heavy to hear of Kathryn’s passing,” senior editor Eric <span data-scayt_word=Klopfer data-scaytid=7>Klopfer</span>&nbsp;of Abrams, her publisher, said in a statement. “We&nbsp;were&nbsp;thankful&nbsp;to have worked with and known her.&nbsp;She was a dynamo, a spitfire, a true original — and an essential figure in the history of American cinema — but most important, a warm, witty and <span data-scayt_word=overflowingly data-scaytid=8>overflowingly</span> generous and radiant person who enjoyed life to the very end.”</p><p>She also was the guiding force behind the establishment of the Robert Altman Collection at the University of Michigan’s Special Collections Library, also home to the Orson <span data-scayt_word=Welles data-scaytid=9>Welles</span> Collection.</p><p>More than 800 feet of material has been assembled, with plans for a touring exhibit. Included in the collection is The Kathryn Reed Story, a short film Altman made as a surprise birthday gift to his wife.</p><p>“While Kathryn Altman’s name does not appear in the credits of any of her husband’s films, the Altman collection is as much a tribute to her as it is to Bob himself,” Phillip <span data-scayt_word=Hallman data-scaytid=10>Hallman</span>, film studies field librarian at the University of Michigan, said in a statement. “Her presence led directly to her stewardship of his legacy, which she worked on tirelessly until the end.”</p><p>Born June 2, 1924, in Glendale, Calif., Altman joined the Earl Carroll troupe shortly after graduating from Hollywood High School. She appeared in many films as an extra.</p><p>Survivors include her children <span data-scayt_word=Konni data-scaytid=11>Konni</span>, Robert and Matthew; stepchildren Christine, Michael and Stephen; grandchildren Dana, Jonathan, Christopher, Reed, Parker, Christian, Alison, Jade, Cora, Charity, Wesley and <span data-scayt_word=Signe data-scaytid=12>Signe</span>; and nine great-grandchildren.</p><p>Arrangements are pending.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKyt06GpsqZdp7KmsIyao62lkaN6pbHAnWSrp5Kav7V5l3BrcGpnZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
