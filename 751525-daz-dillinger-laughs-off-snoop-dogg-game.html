You don’t beat n****s up for me, cuz," he said at the time. As for Snoop, he opened up about moving on from Dillinger in an interview with Noisey back in 2013. "I had to cut out family members," he admitted. "Me and my cousin Daz fell out before. When me and him fell out it was like, I taught you everything you know. I put you in the game. And you go against me? But that’s what the laws of the game do. It puts you in a position to where sometimes you have to have these types of situations to see who really ‘posed to be there. This sh*t ain’t made for everybody. You know what I’m saying? It’s like everybody ain’t gonna be a f*cking star."</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-game-links-with-snoop-dogg>The Game Links With Snoop Dogg</h2></span><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
