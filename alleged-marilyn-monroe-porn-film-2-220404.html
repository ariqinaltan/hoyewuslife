Other bidders had dropped from the race earlier, or offered even lower figures.&nbsp;</p><p>The black and white, six minute film — which was owned by a Spanish collector — shows a woman who resembles a young and heavier Marilyn Monroe masturbating and having sex with an unknown man.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if the high starting price appears to have been the main reason behind the auction’s failing, the question of whether it was Monroe the one who starred in the film was at the center of the dispute.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Barsa, statements pronounced last month by Nancy Carlson —&nbsp; spokeswoman for Authentic Brands Group, which owns the actress’ image and estate rights — “really cooled down the auction.”</p><p>Carlson denied the woman in the film was Monroe, saying “she looks nothing like her.<br>&nbsp;Furthermore, she had added that any sale of the film would invite legal action from ABG for “perpetrating a fraud on the public, violating the Monroe estate’s exclusive rights to her image and other claims of intellectual property infringement”.</p><p>In view of this, Barsa explained to THR how they now “have the fear that if the film is sold, and is subsequently declared in customs, they could paralyze it and drag this thing through a lawsuit.” Barsa is also considering legal action against the licensing company. “It’s foul play,” he said. “They know it’s Marilyn.”&nbsp;</p><p>Barsa claims ABG is protecting their business, “which is normal, but they are only denying, it’s not like they have the name of the actress. They don’t have to prove anything, so all they do is deny. I would do the same if I were them, actually.”</p><p>No further credentials are being searched to back this film, said Barsa, since “there’s no way” to find more certifications. “These things weren’t signed by their authors,” he said. “The people involved in it must be all dead by now if they were adults in 1947.”&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnl5q7pr7ApWSnnaeofKK4y56enpxdoq6ztcuypWaln6O%2FsLGMqaarpl2btq25jGtka2pgaX11ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
