The series is a collaboration with British broadcaster Channel 4, which will air the series exclusively in the UK.</p><p>Alice & Jack comes from award-winning writer Victor Levin (Mad Men, Mad About You), and stars Academy Award®-nominated actress and producer Andrea Riseborough (To Leslie, Birdman) alongside actor, director and screenwriter Domhnall Gleeson (Brooklyn, The Revenant). Aisling Bea (Greatest Days, This Way Up), Aimee Lou Wood (Sex Education, Living) and Sunil Patel (This Time with Alan Partridge, Stath Lets Flats) also appear in supporting roles.</p><p>Finnish film director and screenwriter Juho Kuosmanen, who co-wrote and directed the 2021 Cannes Grand Prix co-winner Compartment 6, is the lead director and Hong Khaou (Lilting) directs the second block of the series.</p><p>Created and written by Levin, Alice & Jack is a love story for the ages. When Alice (Andrea Riseborough) and Jack (Domhnall Gleeson) first meet they’re bound by a connection so powerful it seems nothing can break it, but will their path lead them to a place of happiness and togetherness? Or will life and their own emotional complexities get in the way? Honest, intimate, and surprisingly funny, the series shows love in all its unexpected, technicolor, kaleidoscopic beauty.</p><p>Alice & Jack is an independent UK production from Fremantle in partnership with BAFTA and the Emmy® award-winning company Me + You Productions (I Am Ruth, Close to You), Academy Award®-nominated Groundswell Productions (The Visitor), De Maio Entertainment, and MASTERPIECE in collaboration with Channel 4 which will air the series exclusively in the UK.</p><p>Susanne Simpson, Executive Producer of MASTERPIECE said: “We’re thrilled to come on board with Alice & Jack. This is an exceptionally beautiful and profound series that we are proud to add to our lineup, and I’m looking forward to sharing it with the U.S. audience in Spring 2024.” MASTERPIECE is presented on PBS by GBH Boston.</p><p>Lisa Honig, Senior EVP Distribution North America at Fremantle said “We’re honored to be premiering Alice & Jack at TIFF this weekend and that U.S. audiences will be able to enjoy this rich, emotional and cinematic series on MASTERPIECE PBS next year. It’s the perfect home for this high-quality drama that explores the complexities of love and features moving performances from award-winning actors Andrea Riseborough and Domhnall Gleeson.”</p><p>Lorenzo De Maio, De Maio Entertainment said: “Alice & Jack is an incredibly beautiful love story created by an exceptional team of storytellers, from Vic’s deeply touching scripts to the amazing producing team to Juho and Hong’s unique vision and the brilliant cast, led by Andrea and Domhnall.
