The Cowboys on Tuesday released him following months of speculation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>With Romo's decision to retire, it means his last game came in the regular season finale in Philly on Jan. 1. In that game, with the Cowboys' playoff berth already sealed, Romo came into the game cold and led his team down the field to score in the second quarter. Romo completed 3 of 4 passes for 29 yards, including a three-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. The <a href=# rel=noopener>Eagles</a> came back and went on to win 27-13.&nbsp;</p><p>The rise of Dak Prescott in Dallas spelled the end of Romo's career. Romo missed the first 10 weeks of the 2016 season with a back injury. Prescott took over, went on an 11-game win streak and wasn't&nbsp;going to give the job back.&nbsp;</p><p>Romo is the Cowboys' all-time passing leader after joining them as an undrafted free agent in 2003 out of Eastern Illinois. He ended up becoming the starter in 2006 and made four Pro Bowls with the Cowboys, his only NFL team. Romo surpassed the 4,000-yard mark four times in his career -- a threshold an Eagles quarterback has never passed. While Romo compiled some huge stats during his career, he'll also be remembered for his 2-4 career playoff record.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>In 19 career games against the Eagles, Romo compiled a record of 11-8. He completed 61.98 percent of his passes for 3,513 yards, 21 touchdowns, 15 interceptions and a passer rating of 87.6.&nbsp;</p><p>The Eagles also sacked him 37 times, more than any other team in the league.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r67CrKeoqqSovam1y5qbnqSgnbaiesKopGimlqF8uLXToWStp56uerO7zKhkrJ2kYsGwedGeq6KqlWKubrjOqKJmmaRitaq%2FjJyYq52Vp3q3v4yemKCklah8dIGYcmlpZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
