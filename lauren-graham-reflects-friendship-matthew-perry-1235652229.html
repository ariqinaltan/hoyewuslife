And that’s something to be thankful for, and again, the book [Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing] really meant something to him, so it was a really happy year for him.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Graham added, “No one made me laugh as hard. I mean, just tears, streaming. There was just such joy in being around him and being his friend.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The Los Angeles Police Department found the Friends star unresponsive&nbsp;in the hot tub at his L.A. home on Oct. 28.
