Gothy then laughed: "I'm really glad that my co-stars enjoy my being there and really appreciate the fact that I can't do these challenges very well."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/21f9a2fc607a-gothy-kendoll-snatch-game.jpg><p id=eor3Ux37bHj data-wc=38>The 26-year-old then added: "I'm a drag DJ, so to have to perform and do musicals and pretend to be Kim Woodburn, it's just not what I do. I'm glad that I got an opportunity to challenge myself."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Drag Race UK's Keta Minaj reveals it was 'her time' following shock elimination – exclusive" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/8e73bfd61c68-keta-minaj-promo-look.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Drag Race UK's Keta Minaj reveals it was 'her time' following shock elimination – exclusive" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Drag Race UK's Keta Minaj reveals it was 'her time' following shock elimination – exclusive</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=ezu7vElDHl3 data-wc=74>However, this hasn't ruled out a future appearance for the queen, as she commented that competing on Drag Race is "hilarious". Musing about a possible future appearance alongside her drag daughter Sminty Drop, Gothy said: "It'd be quite funny to do drag houses as a team. But when I think of others like Sasha and Kerri [Colby], we would definitely lose to them. Aja, Dahlia [Sin] and Kandy [Muse], we'd absolutely lose to them."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7897ea2f749-gothy-kendoll-pink-dress.jpg><p id=eSbSq5E0Lxs data-wc=46>Despite admitting to not excelling in the challenges, <strong>Gothy never lost her fighting spirit&nbsp;</strong>and it was on full display in her final episode as she clashed with La Grande Dame over wanting a role and was one of the standout performers in the reading mini-challenge.</p><p id=eeRV6hGatki data-wc=99>Reflecting on this, Gothy mused: "Snatch Game was the only time that I didn't enjoy myself, having the walkthrough with Ru really psyched me out. I was very nervous that I just didn't have fun that episode at all. There's a real change to this episode because I came back with the same mentality from the episode before which was just to enjoy it, have fun and try my best. I also think Tia saying that she saw something in me and related to me made me feel like I had to do her a bit of a service."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d6d98c05ffd7-gothy-kendoll-runway.jpg><p id=eekmHBq4VbV data-wc=116>Although some fans were surprised that fellow UK-based queen Tia Kofi opted to save her last week, Gothy wasn't too shocked, telling us: "<strong>It could have gone either way</strong>. I was a little bit surprised because she asked whether I thought with what the judges were saying whether I'd overcome it and I gave her the honest answer which was 'probably not'. I was glad that she saved me because it was another opportunity to have fun. Keta [Minaj] had been in the bottom the episode before so it made sense for Keta to go home. People say that I had confidence issues and was a little bit quiet, but Keta was definitely quieter than me."</p><p id=eN5bkK8j2ff data-wc=72>However, despite coming across as not having confidence, during the series, this is far from who Gothy is as a person. "I was lost in the challenges because I didn't know how to apply what the Gothy brand," she explained. "<strong>I would get the same critique, which was 'you need to be more confident', but I'm just quietly confident and I'm not on 100 all the time, like the other queens are.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5a4342c1510c-gothy-kendoll-choriza-may-scarlet-envy.jpg><p id=e31sTWghQjG data-wc=57>"That's not a negative thing, but I think in a Drag Race context it is. I know what kind of drag queen I am and I know what my strengths are. <strong>On reflection, I realised that just because my drag doesn't fit the context of Drag Race, it doesn't mean that I'm not a good drag queen.</strong>"</p><p id=eo24FbgPC5h data-wc=64>The star had a "full-circle" moment with her elimination, as during the runway, which this week had a 'glow up' theme, Gothy was eliminated in her <a class=hm-link href=#>Queen Elizabeth</a> look, just like on her first series. "I remember the first time, I really hated the outfit, I really didn't like it when I was there, so in my head that was the one to redo."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2d2870cbb8f1-gothy-kendoll-tiger.jpg><p id=eenNwT9k5RJ data-wc=23>Deciding which royal might make a good guest judge, Gothy joked: "Maybe Fergie as she seems like a bit of a drag queen."</p><p id=eeAFZ1UT4y_4 data-wc=21><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Jonbers Blonde reveals 'tricksters' in Drag Race UK vs the World cast and reveals whether she'd host Drag Race Ireland</a></p><p id=eZLlTbgpmD data-wc=14><strong>READ: </strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Arantxa Castilla-La Mancha reveals why Drag Race experience made her want to 'puke'</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
