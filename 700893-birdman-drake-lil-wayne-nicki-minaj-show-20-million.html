After all, it's been a long time (almost a year, and almost a decade before that) since <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">they shared the stage for a performance</a>. Considering the legendary status that they all reached in the game, people would pay a lot of money to see such spectacle. Baby knows this, and told The 85 South Comedy Show podcast just how much a potential show could net the iconic trifecta.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"So you know with Nicki and Drake, that s**t about $15-20million a show," Birdman stated. "Big facts. A lot of [money on the table]. $4-5million a show. We’ve been offered about $4-5million a show. That’s without Drake and Nicki." Of course, it's unsurprising that Lil Wayne alone would be worth so much for a concert. However, his remarks open up the possibility that a Young Money reunion show (or tour, hopefully) would be a massive moment for the culture.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-birdman-speaks-on-money-making-potential-of-drake-nicki-minaj-lil-wayne-show>Birdman Speaks On Money-Making Potential Of Drake, Nicki Minaj & Lil Wayne Show</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Still, we do have to recognize that Young Money is no longer what it was, with each artist going on to shape their own careers. Sure, Weezy still commits to his label artists and Nicki Minaj remains on Young Money, but Drake moved onto OVO and Republic, which Nicki also partnered with. Regardless, Drizzy's still loyal to Birdman, Cash Money, and Young Money. "I’m always going to be involved in the Cash Money/Young Money imprint,” he told Rap Radar in 2019. “And my loyalty, like I said, always lies there."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, the last time the three performed together was at the 6 God's October World Weekend festival in August of 2022. It was the first time they did so in nearly ten years, and it made for an electrifying moment. With <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Pink Friday 2</a>, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">For All The Dogs</a>, and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Tha Carter VI</a> on the way, hopefully they can reunite on wax, too. If not, they have that $20 million show to wager on.

He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output.

As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C.
