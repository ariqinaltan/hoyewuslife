Andrew's attempt to explain his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein backfired and he was heavily criticised for showing a lack of empathy towards Epstein's victims and remorse over his friendship with the disgraced financier. The Duke has only been seen in public a handful of times since the interview and a large number of his major patronages have accepted his resignation and others have distanced themselves from him.</p><p id=e_8owsDPhWbk data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>The real reason Prince Harry and Meghan Markle turned down Apartment 1 in Kensington Palace</a></strong></p><h2>Sarah, Duchess of York</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2eb223987385-sarah-ferguson-z.jpg><p id=e8Vixa6sN_E5 data-wc=49>Andrew's ex-wife the Duchess of York was reportedly frozen out of the royal family when their marriage broke down.
