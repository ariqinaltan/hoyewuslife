Keri Russell, previously of prestige spy drama The Americans, stars as Kate Wyler, a newly appointed American ambassador to the United Kingdom who is tasked with avoiding an international incident, while simultaneously being surreptitiously primed for the vice-presidency back home.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Matters are further complicated by the expectations placed on a female public figure to "look the part," not to mention the presence of Kate's estranged husband Hal, played by Rufus Sewell, a career politician who is unused to seeing his wife take the ambassadorial spotlight.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Without getting into too many spoilers, it's safe to say that the finale of Season 1 of The Politician ended on a pretty explosive cliffhanger—literally. Following the revelation of who exactly was behind the bombing in the Persian Gulf, the shit really hit the fan, leaving the respective fates of several key characters hanging in the balance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">For viewers who have already binged all eight episodes, here's everything we know about where The Diplomat might go next.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Will there be a Season 2 of The Diplomat?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Yes! Netflix has officially confirmed that The Diplomat has been renewed for a second term after it debuted at Number 1 spot on Netflix's weekly Top 10 ranking of global English-language programming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">"Fans around the world are loving every minute of The Diplomat’s gripping and propulsive drama, and embracing Keri Russell’s powerful performance as Kate Wyler," Jinny Howe, Vice President of Drama at Netflix, said in an official statement. "After that jaw-dropping cliffhanger, we can’t wait for them to see what the amazing visionary team of Debora Cahn, Janice Williams and Keri Russell have in store for Season 2."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">Russell herself has said that she is "thrilled" to be headed back for "another round of this smart screwball show."</p><img alt="the diplomat keri russell as kate wyler in episode 108 of the diplomat cr alex baileynetflix © 2023" title="the diplomat keri russell as kate wyler in episode 108 of the diplomat cr alex baileynetflix © 2023" width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/diplomat-108-unit-02261rc-6446e38b37800.jpeg><span class="css-1avdefm e6iqukd1">Netflix</span><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h2 css-17l0bb et3p2gv0">Who will be in Season 2?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 et3p2gv0">While that cliffhanger ending left a huge question mark hanging over the heads of several main characters, if we are to assume everybody survived then the entire cast is expected to return for Season 2.
