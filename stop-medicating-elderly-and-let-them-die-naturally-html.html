High blood pressure pills, like beta-blockers, can cause dizziness, blurred vision and fatigue.</p><p>But older people are often afraid of causing offence to doctors by refusing medication that they do not want, said Dr Byatt.</p><p>Writing in the journal Evidence Based Medicine, Dr Byatt said: “The data strongly suggests that we are over-treating many over-80s.</p><p>“The largest trials of antihypertensive therapy and statins in this age group show at best a marginal clinical reduction in stroke and very modest clinical reduction in other cardiovascular end points.”</p><p>Dr Byatt said studies have shown that: “these medications are greatly over-prescribed in the healthy elderly, and largely irrelevant in the frail elderly.”</p><p>“In my experience, it is not uncommon in the oldest of these often frail but relatively disease-free patients, to see death as the next natural event in their life, especially welcome if they have outlived their peers,” he added.</p><p>“However this cohort is often deferential to the doctor, whom they frequently want to please or at least not upset.</p><p>“Most of the patients will probably eschew the modest potential benefits, preferring the reduced burden of polypharmacy and side-effects.”</p><p>Older people are also concerned that medication, while preventing death, could leave them suffering the incapacitating effects of a minor stroke, he warned.</p><p>“Studies show that patient’s values and preferences relating to stroke vary enormously and differ significantly from physicians.</p><p>“We need actively to rethink out priorities and beliefs about stroke prevention, actively informing and involving the views of the key person, the patient.”</p><p>A study by Yale University this week showed that high blood pressure tablets greatly increased the rate of fatal falls in the elderly.</p><p>Blood pressure guidelines in the US are currently being changed because of concerns that the risks of medicating elderly people outweigh the benefits.</p><p>The National Institute for Clinical Excellence said it will consider revising British guidelines when they come up for review.</p><p>However charities warned that other studies have proven the effectiveness of statins and antihypertensive drugs.</p><p>Dr Madina Kara, Neuroscientist at the Stroke Association, said: “Without question, doctors should discuss all available treatment options when prescribing statins and antihypertensive drugs to older patients.</p><p>“However, it is vital that people at risk of stroke, and who could benefit from these types of preventative medications, are identified and treated.</p><p>“The success of statins and antihypertensive drugs in reducing high cholesterol and high blood pressure has been proven in several randomised controlled trials, and incorporated in standard NHS practice. It is estimated that statins alone save 7,000 lives in the UK every year.</p><p>“Anyone at all worried about their medication to reduce their risk of stroke should speak to their GP to discuss the treatment option that works best for you.”</p><p>Thembi Nkala, Senior Cardiac Nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: “This thought provoking paper questions how heart protective pills are used with adults over 80.</p><p>“Interestingly, there is still evidence suggesting these pills can be beneficial for some people of this age. Further research would help us understand the pros and cons better so in the interim a cautious approach in prescribing these drugs for the elderly is required.</p><p>“If you fall in this category of patients, discuss with your doctor the need for this treatment, who will help you weigh the benefits against the risks. Your doctor should also consider your preference and general wellbeing before making a recommendation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwtMSao62gX5q5pbHRaGhpbmZohXWFjoyrqKhdorKltcKaq6Kml2KyrbDEq6OyZZGjsW64xK1kraCVonqltcRmpZqspaeurbjYZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
