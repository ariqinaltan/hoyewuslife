Like sister Tatiana Schlossberg, he chose to attend Yale University and pursue a bachelor's degree in history, which he received in 2015, per <a href=#>People</a>. From there, he transferred to older sister Rose Kennedy Schlossberg's alma mater, Harvard University, and graduated from both Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School in 2022.</p><p dir=ltr>Over the years, he's dabbled in politics and has worked in the Senate as both a page and an intern for Secretary of State John Kerry, who once <a href=#>praised his sense of humor</a>. Jack's interest in politics, combined with his looks, means he's often been compared to his grandfather, John F. Kennedy. However, Jack has often admitted that he's not sure if he'll follow in his family's political footsteps. Speaking with <a href=#>People</a>, he addressed the JFK comparisons directly, saying, "We live in a really different time than he did, and I'm trying to figure out what I'm really interested in and what I want to do." He also told <a href=#>Today</a> that while he's inspired by and proud of his family's history, "I'm still trying to make my own way, figure things out."</p><p dir=ltr>Jack's other interests include writing (he's penned pieces for Politico, The Washington Post, and The New York Times, per <a href=#>E! News</a>), as well as acting. Fans of "Blue Bloods" will have seen him on the show's season 8 finale in 2018, per <a href=#>People</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamljZ4F5fY6pqZ6rmZmyr8DImqNmn6KWu6Wvx6KjnaqVo3q4tM5mnqudp2LCsXnTqGSbnV2cvLOzxKisrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
