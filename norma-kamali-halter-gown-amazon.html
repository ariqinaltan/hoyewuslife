I have two this summer — which I’ve since learned is considered light — but between travel arrangements, getting time off, and coordinating with families, I’m both mentally and monetarily at my wits end. Because of this, I've given very little thought to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>what I’ll be wearing</a>. That is, until I discovered <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">this viral (and on-sale) Amazon dress</a> that can be worn more than 10 ways.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">72Styles’ Infinity Dress</a>&nbsp; has made its rounds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>on TikTok</a>, where it now boasts more than 73 million views. There, users have showcased the various ways to wrap and style the convertible piece, creating entirely new looks with a range of styles — from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nocaes>sexy looks</a> to more <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nocaes>classic and modest</a> ones — out of the single dress. Basically, it’s the gown Jane wished she knew about in “27 Dresses.” Right now it’s on sale for just $50 at Amazon, where it boasts more than 6,800 five-star ratings.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shop now</strong>: $50 (Originally $79); <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">amazon.com</a></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Until outfit-repeating ceases to be a faux pas, this dress that’s practically an entire wardrobe in-one is a must-have. The long, four-way stretch straps allow you to create new bodices, sleeves, and designs with easy wrapping and knotting. As <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>TikTok creator @camillaconca6 shows</a> in her video, the straps can be stretched and twisted to create sleeves that offer more coverage or a chic one-shoulder look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While this piece is designed for bridesmaid parties wanting a cohesive color scheme with individualized looks, shoppers also note that it’s an excellent wedding guest dress. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">One person</a> said that they wore the piece as a one-shoulder dress for a wedding before converting it to a more dance-friendly halter for the reception, adding that it garnered them “so many compliments.” According to another shopper who wore it for a wedding, the dress was a “show stopper.” “The color was gorgeous, the fit was very comfortable, and I did not need a bra at all,” they wrote. &nbsp;<a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Someone else</a> even noted that they weren’t the only guest to show up in it, though they happily reported that, because of different stylings, it “wasn’t too obvious.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 72Styles dress is available in two one-size-fits-all options, including regular (sizes 0 to 16) and plus size (sizes 18 to 24). While that all-encompassing term might have previously led many of us astray, a number of customers noted that it’s surprisingly accurate. “We purchased this dress for bridesmaids… [and it fit] all different size women from size 6 to 18,” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">wrote one customer</a>. <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Another called</a> this aspect “brilliant,” explaining that its versatility allows it to “fit and flatter all kinds of shapes and sizes.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The versatility and budget-friendly sale price of the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">72Styles Infinity Dress</a> is guaranteed to make that upcoming wedding fun instead of stressful. So if you’re like me and have a few events on your calendar, grab the dress that can be reworked and reworn while it’s on sale for just $50 at Amazon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3yvu9GmmGajkaKurbWMoZilrJWneqi71qdkmqWRr7yv</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
