It’s been nine years since the final episode of the original series—the one that brilliantly maybe-sort-of revealed how scripted the show actually was—and it’ll be Barton’s first time on the show. You’ll no doubt remember her from her starring role as Marissa Cooper on the iconic early-aughts primetime soap&nbsp;The O.C.&nbsp;on Fox, from which the MTV reality show&nbsp;Laguna Beach&nbsp;and its offshoot&nbsp;The Hills&nbsp;were spawned.<br></p><p>But though she hasn't had a role quite as memorable as Marissa, that doesn't mean Barton has stayed out of the limelight.</p><p>So where has she been? And how did she end up on&nbsp;The Hills: New Beginnings? Here are some of the highlights of the past 11 years of her career, leading up to her new MTV gig.</p><p><strong>(Warning:&nbsp;</strong>Spoilers for&nbsp;The O.C.&nbsp;below, though to be fair, the statute of limitations is probably up on that.)</p><p>Barton left the show that launched her into stardom after her character Marissa was killed off in a pretty tragic—albeit sort of anticlimactic—car accident. But exactly why this happened is kind of disputed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2XTVrBQRVYcnN5eJQR629-1920-80.jpg><p>In&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-oc-10th-anniversary-josh-schwartz_n_3705457 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>an interview with HuffPost</a>,&nbsp;O.C.&nbsp;creator Josh Schwartz explained the decision to kill off Marissa thusly:</p><p>So it was a creative decision, not a personal one (or even one Barton necessarily made) to hear the showrunner tell it. But Barton has maintained,<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/style/mischa-barton-the-hills-mtv.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>&nbsp;as recently as May 2019</a>, that the decision to leave was hers. “I just had a lot in my career that I wanted to do and accomplish....I felt like things were really heavily reliant upon me, and I was getting no time to do any of the other offers that were out there,” she told the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/style/mischa-barton-the-hills-mtv.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>New York Times</a>.<br></p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

While anything that appeared in the pages of a tabloid should be taken with a grain of salt, Barton nevertheless started to gain the reputation for being a party girl, which may have hurt her career.</p><p>In 2008, she<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/57590/mischa-barton-dinged-with-dui-possession-charges referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>&nbsp;was arrested and eventually charged</a>&nbsp;with misdemeanors after police found she possessed a small amount of marijuana and a higher-than-legal blood alcohol level after a routine traffic stop in West Hollywood. She later told Ryan Seacrest, “I’m really disappointed in myself.”</p><p>There were also unflattering photos sold of her, and a lot of paparazzi attention. It clearly got to her, as one E! Story from the time suggests she was visibly upset after arriving to a club&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/68242/mischa-barton-s-pissed-at-parking-lot-paps referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>to find a bunch of photographers waiting</a>.</p><p>At this time, she also embraced her sexiness, according to E!,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/839974/the-rise-and-fall-of-mischa-barton-a-timeline referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>appearing in&nbsp;Maxim&nbsp;and FHM</a>.</p><p>The short-lived, Ashton Kutcher-produced drama series about models,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beautiful_Life:_TBL referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Beautiful Life</a>, featured Barton in a primo role, as supermodel Sonja Stone. But the show was cancelled after two episodes due to poor ratings. (TBH, we think they should reboot it—would totally watch now.)</p><p>Also this year, Barton was hospitalized in New York for a “nonemergency” “medical issue,” according to her publicist at the time—an event that was also&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/136217/mischa-barton-out-of-psych-ward-ready-for-life referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>covered with much curiosity</a>&nbsp;by the tabloids. In an interview with&nbsp;The View, Barton suggested that her stay<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/143661/mischa-barton-s-silly-hospitalization-continues-to-confound referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>&nbsp;had to do with painkillers</a>&nbsp;that she initially started taking for her wisdom teeth, though didn’t go into very much detail.</p><p>In 2012, Barton launched a now-defunct fashion website called Mischa’s Place, and then opened some retail stores in Dubai,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.racked.com/2012/5/10/7725833/mischa-barton-opens-a-store-in-dubai-yes-dubai referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>according to Racked</a>.</p><p>Also that year, she appeared in leopard print underwear in the music video for a song from Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds (the band formed by the former Oasis member), called “Everybody’s On the Run.” It’s kind of a weird video:</p><p>From 2012 to 2016, she starred in a slew of small roles in mostly independent movies,&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0059215/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>according to her IMDB page</a>. She also had a fair share of high-profile drama, including some tabloid-y breakups and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/643969/mischa-barton-suing-mom-for-allegedly-stealing-money-from-the-actress referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>a very public legal fight</a>&nbsp;with her mother in 2015. Still, these years found Barton lying pretty low.</p><p>In 2016, she made the beginnings of a comeback to stardom with a contestant role on&nbsp;Dancing With The Stars.</p><p>But unfortunately, she was eliminated second. In December of 2016, she spoke negatively about the experience to&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.theringer.com/2016/12/20/16043608/mischa-barton-10-years-after-the-oc-f6127d1cd4c2#.8mvk31tk1 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>The Ringer</a>, in an interview that framed her as a teen star approaching her 30th birthday:</p><p>Yikes. Sounds like she did not have a good time.</p><p>In an interview with Amanda Knox, Barton revealed that she found out an ex of hers was allegedly trying to shop around a sex tape for half a million dollars. Even worse? She read it in the tabloids. Instead of cowering, she made the decision to go public with the story and&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.eonline.com/news/940089/mischa-barton-opens-up-to-amanda-knox-about-her-revenge-porn-story referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>filed restraining orders</a>&nbsp;against that ex as well as his friend, another former partner who she alleged knew about the images as well. Ultimately, the two men agreed not to release or distribute the material, but&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/style/mischa-barton-the-hills-mtv.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Barton told the&nbsp;New York Times</a>&nbsp;that the case dominated her life.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>COURT VICTORY today with Mischa Barton.
