For instance, over the weekend, Melo was asked to do the "Pass The Phone" challenge with other Blazers stars. For those who don't know, the challenge asks the first person to deliver a description of who they are passing the phone to, without naming that person. Then the next person does the same thing and the process repeats over and over.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/22/88/348822_f976966980a2a3ad5c220e93a31be051.jpg><p><h6>Steph Chambers/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Unfortunately, Melo did not get the message that you are not supposed to say the person's name. As you can see in the clip below, Melo immediately begins to describe Enes Kanter, and even says his name numerous times. Eventually, the clip went viral after being posted by HouseOfHighlights, and Melo couldn't help but laugh at himself as he took to the comments with some laughing emojis.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">To be fair, Melo is one of the older players in the league, so when it comes to TikTok challenges, we should all be giving him a break.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
