However, Houston does not have a star on the famous Hollywood sidewalk, prompting many fans to contact the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to ask why she did not have one of the more than 2,000 stars on the <a href=# id=auto-tag_hollywood-walk-fame data-tag=hollywood-walk-fame>Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>.</p><p>According to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, Houston was selected for a star in 1995, but a date was never requested by the singer’s representatives for a star-unveiling ceremony. Once selected, a star has five years to schedule their ceremony, so in 2000, Houston’s approved selection expired.</p><p><strong><a href=#>STORY: Whitney Houston Remembered With Cable, Broadcast Specials</a></strong></p><p>“It is up to the family and or representatives to connect with the Hollywood Chamber regarding the issue of a star ceremony,” said <strong>Ana Martinez</strong>, producer of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p><p>&nbsp;“At this time we believe that the family should be left to grieve for their dearly departed,” she added. “At such time as they are ready, we would be open to discussions about setting a date to immortalize the legendary Whitney Houston with a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>VIDEO: Whitney Houston’s Final Performance Two Days Before Her Death</a></strong></p><p>In order for Houston to get a star, Martinez told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> that she would have to be reinstated and approved by the five-person committee. On average, 20 to 24 stars are installed per year. As of Tuesday, when Simpsons creator <strong>Matt Groening </strong>(subject of THR’s <a href=# rel=noopener>recent cover story</a>) receives his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, there will be 2,461 stars in total.</p><p>Houston died on Saturday at the Beverly Hilton. She was 48 years old. The six-time Grammy winning singer had performed an impromptu number onstage two days earlier at a pre-Grammy party. A tribute to the late singer was added at the 11th hour to the Grammy telecast. Host<strong> LL Cool J</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>opened the show with a prayer</a> remembering Houston, and <strong>Jennifer Hudson</strong> sang Houston’s&nbsp; “I Will Always Love You.”</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnarAqq%2BMp5ywq1%2BstarAzZ6wZqCfqsC1u81mm56ZpJ16uK3LpGSonl2brq6xjKyrmqpdZ4ZxfZJuZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
