She probably didn’t expect she was going to get invited to anyone’s prom though.</p><p>One brave fan took it upon himself to do just that when his time came to have a word with The Princess Of Staten Island. He actually asked her to go with him to his senior prom.</p><p>This guy’s brother was filming the whole thing and he provided subtitles for what he said to her. Maybe this guy just hasn’t heard the news about Mella and Corey Graves, but if you put “Carmella boyfriend” in your Google machine it’s pretty obvious at this point that she’s taken.</p><p>Fan: Hey what’s up? So, I’m gonna be a senior in high school and I wanted to know if it was possible if you wanted to go to senior prom with me?</p><p>Carmella: Hmmm, well, we’ll have to wait and see if I’m around town at the time.</p><p>Fan: Alright, cool. Awesome.</p><p>It’s pretty great that this kid took the chance and asked Mella out. She replied with two emojis and she thought it was pretty priceless too. Maybe Corey Graves would be down to let her go because you would think game has to respect game in this instance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><span class=author-name>H Jenkins</span> <span></span><p>I love pro wrestling and hate BS. These two things drive me. Years of experience in writing, journalism, and digging exclusive insider info for Ringside News. Worked in finance before realizing pro wrestling journalism made much less sense. Pro beachballs at pro wrestling shows, pro dives if someone catches, anti bullies, olives, and pineapples on pizza.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7XNoKqinJWjsri%2FjZympmdiZX56e49xZmppX5uur3nArKKsZZOWv66xy6WYZqyfYrWqv4ysnKehn6d6sb7OpmSarF2sxKZ50q6kpp2iqLmiuYymnJ6sXZy%2FprHTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
