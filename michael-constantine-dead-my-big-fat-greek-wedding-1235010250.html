I didn‚Äôt know Nia then [she also penned the screenplay], and I was anxious about someone writing some Greek thing. Was it going to be baloney or was it going to be something by somebody who really knows Greeks? So I read the script and I said, ‚ÄòYes, this person obviously knows Greeks.'‚Äù</p><p>The know-it-all Gus was famous for thinking that Windex would cure just about any ailment. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm actually sick of Windex,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere must have been hundreds of bottles sent to me, and then there were all those people who asked me to autograph their Windex bottles.‚Äù</p><p>He also reprised the role for the short-lived 2003 CBS sitcom&nbsp;My Big Fat Greek Life.</p><p>On Wednesday, Vardalos paid tribute to the man who played her boisterous Greek father on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Twitter</a>, writing: ‚ÄúMichael Constantine, the dad to our cast-family, a gift to the written word, and always a friend.
