Of course, what got her on the map was her work with <a href=# class=text-word rel>Drake</a> on Certified Lover Boy with "Yebba's Heartbreak" back in 2021. The song has over 240 million streams on Spotify which is currently her most popular track. Other than that big co-sign, many people might have never been able to hear Yebba's soothing voice.
