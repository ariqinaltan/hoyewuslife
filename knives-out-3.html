Directed by Rian Johnson and inspired by classic mystery novels à la Agatha Christie, the Knives Out franchise has become a must-watch for both fans of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g2509/movies-to-watch-before-30/>classic films</a> and casual viewers who've fallen in love with Daniel Craig's performance as the suave Southern detective Benoit Blanc. Arguably, the best thing about the series of films is their variety; after the original movie about the death of a wealthy patriarch became a 2019 box office hit (and cemented itself as a perfect <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/news/g5011/fall-movies/>fall movie</a>), Netflix produced the 2022 follow-up Glass Onion, which put Blanc at odds with eccentric billionaire Miles Bron (Edward Norton). Whether it's the near-absurd settings, A-list ensemble cast, or mind-blowing plot twists, you can bet whodunnit fans would tune into these movies as long as they keep making them.</p><p>Luckily, Johnson and Netflix confirmed in 2021 that Knives Out would get not one but <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a36002111/knives-out-sequels-netflix/>two sequels on the platform</a>, and the stage is just about set for Blanc's next case. Below, we're keeping track of everything we know about the third Knives Out film so far.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The next Benoit Blanc mystery, the follow-up to Knives Out and Glass Onion, is called Wake Up Dead Man. pic.twitter.com/pdDXRDmwcI<a href=# data-url=https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1794005920898502741 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>May 24, 2024</a></p><h2 id=when-will-39-knives-out-39-3-be-released-3>When will 'Knives Out' 3 be released?</h2><p>On May 24, 2024, Johnson and Netflix announced that the third Knives Out film, Wake Up Dead Man, will arrive on the streaming giant in <strong>2025</strong>. The director gave the news via a motion-art teaser shared on <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://x.com/rianjohnson/status/1794005920898502741 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>X</a> (formerly Twitter) where the new title is paired with an ominous black casket.

Johnson paired the news with a first-look image of Benoit Blanc; in the black-and-white pic, the detective has noticeably longer, perhaps even blonder hair while standing on a soundstage.</p><p>"Aaaaand we’re off! Today is day 1 of shooting on the next Benoit Blanc mystery 'Wake Up Dead Man' - see you on the other side," Johnson wrote in a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://x.com/rianjohnson/status/1800166308321104341 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) about the news.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mvJdGBHYxavzFP6GsFyE5a-1920-80.jpg><h2 id=who-has-been-cast-in-39-knives-out-39-3-3>Who has been cast in 'Knives Out' 3?</h2><p>After weeks of near-constant cast announcements, we finally have our full roster for the third Knives Out ensemble!

All fans currently have to speculate over is the title and a single teaser from the teaser Netflix shared in their official <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wake-up-dead-man-knives-out-mystery-cast-release-date-plot referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/wake-up-dead-man-knives-out-mystery-cast-release-date-plot data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>Tudum announcement.</a> In the brief clip, Craig says in his iconic Southern drawl, "In the beginning, the knives came out. Then, behold, the glass was shattered. But my most dangerous case yet is about to be revealed."</p><p>So allow your imagination to run wild over the next year before the film's 2025.
