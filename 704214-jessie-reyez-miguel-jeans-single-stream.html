The new single landed on Friday (August 18), following the "Criminal" hitmaker's joint effort with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Lil Yachty</a>, "Number 9," the weekend before. This release is equally as buzz-worthy, and extremely sensual in nature. It finds two lovers going back and forth with bedroom innuendos, seemingly talking each other through an orgasm with their verses.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"'Cause I might let you do it, I might let you shoot it / 'Cause she need some milk / She need somethin' real, real bad," the Canadian croons on the first verse after carrying us through the chorus. "The atoms between us have melted away, and we're one tonight / When I see the way of your eyes, I know I, I'm doin' it right," Miguel later responds.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jessie-reyez-and-miguel-turn-up-the-heat-on-jeans>Jessie Reyez and Miguel Turn Up the Heat on "JEANS"</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In the accompanying music video, Reyez is arrested while robbing a small convenience store, and she certainly gives the officer processing her a hard time with her bratty antics. When she's finally made it to her cell, she and Miguel get as close as they can with the bars separating them. Though there's only so much they can do physically, their lust for each other is obvious, and expressed through song rather than touch.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out the sultry visual for Jessie Reyez's "JEANS" single with Miguel above.
