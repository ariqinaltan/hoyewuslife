The trope began with <a href=# id=auto-tag_horse-whisperer data-tag=horse-whisperer>The Horse Whisperer</a>, a 1998 weepy directed by and starring <a href=# id=auto-tag_robert-redford data-tag=robert-redford>Robert Redford</a>. He plays Tom Booker, a Montana wrangler/Zen master who helps a tomboy named Grace (<a href=# id=auto-tag_scarlett-johansson data-tag=scarlett-johansson>Scarlett Johansson</a>, then 13) and her horse, Pilgrim, overcome the trauma of a riding accident that left her leg partially amputated.</p><p>Based on the 1995 best-seller by Nicholas Evans, the movie was the first to feature Redford on both sides of the camera. It was also Johansson’s first starring role in a studio picture. (She had earned a Spirit award nomination for the 1996 indie Manny & Lo.)</p><p>The shoot was not without its controversies: While trainer Buck <span data-scayt_word=Brannaman data-scaytid=2>Brannaman</span>, who inspired the title character, served as a technical consultant, the final cut contained several horse-training no-nos, including Redford wearing a large ring — a sure way to lose a finger. The film drew high marks from <span data-scayt_word=THR data-scaytid=3>THR</span>, which called it a “vital, subtle story” and singled out its trio of leads — Kristin Scott Thomas rounds things out as Grace’s workaholic mom — as its strongest asset. “Johansson is winning,” the review noted. “She gains our sympathies as a young girl whose future has been horribly changed.” Richard <span data-scayt_word=LaGravanese data-scaytid=4>LaGravanese</span>, who co-wrote the screenplay (he also adapted 1995’s The Bridges of Madison County), says Johansson “brought a heartache to the part that seemed to come from experience beyond her years.”</p><p>The $80 million movie was a hit for Touchstone, earning $187 million globally ($280 million today). Johansson’s films have earned $3.6 billion, making her the highest-grossing actress of all time.
