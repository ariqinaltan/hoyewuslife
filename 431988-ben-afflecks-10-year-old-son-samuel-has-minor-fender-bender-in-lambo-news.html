When they exited their vehicle, young Sam decided to jump behind the wheel in the driver's seat. Affleck was standing right outside of the vehicle and Lopez was reportedly in the backseat, so there wasn't any problem with the boy pretending to drive.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, things took a turn when&nbsp;something occurred as Samuel was in the driver's seat and backed into another vehicle. The New York Post reportedly spoke with an employee at the dealership who said: "When [Samuel] got into the car, it jerked back and forth. We have a small lot and the cars are close. Everybody was OK!"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">E! News claims Affleck's rep told them that "everyone is fine" and there "is no damage." Photos of a distraught Samuel have circulated online.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Erika Marie is a seasoned journalist, editor, and ghostwriter who works predominantly in the fields of music, spirituality, mental health advocacy, and social activism.
