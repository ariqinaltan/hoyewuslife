It’s probably close to six years old, and it’s seen better days. But I can’t part with it, because the formula is just too good. That special little compact is the original KKW Beauty under-eye brightening powder, which—along with Kim Kardashian’s entire makeup and fragrance line—was dissolved several years ago to make room for something new.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, Kardashian is making beauty dreams come true by relaunching her makeup line under her skincare brand, SKKN by Kim. The first drop brings back some truly beloved favorites from the KKW Beauty days: 15 shades of creamy lip liner, 10 shades of the Soft Matte bullet lipstick, and a matte eye shadow palette full of everyday essentials. I caught up with the beauty and fashion mogul last week to chat all about how this new makeup collection came to be, and when fans can expect a return of their other favorite bygone products and Kim-approved fragrances.</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Why did you decide to launch under the SKKN brand versus Skims or an entirely new makeup-only brand?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">I had KKW Fragrance, KKW Beauty, and then I was gonna launch KKW Skin, but if you think about it, that’s three different partnerships, three different social media channels to run, three different calendars that I would have to partner up with, three different shipping charges for the customer—when it’s all under one beauty brand. So I always wanted to shut everything down and launch one beauty brand that would have everything you could imagine, from skincare, color cosmetics, fragrance, hair care, nails—whatever, you know, is under the beauty umbrella. When I was rebranding and thinking of a name, I always loved the name SKKN, not just for skincare, but spelled like that, because my initials are in the middle, obviously.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This new brand, I want it to be like 100 percent authentically me. I didn’t want to do all of the purple shadows and red lips and all this stuff that I don’t personally wear. I always wanted it to be just the products and the color tones that would enhance your skin and your skin tone. And to find, like, huge shade ranges and lips and lip liners and whatever we do, you know; or contouring, and all the stuff that we’ll eventually come out with—I always wanted one brand that can sell all of everything in every beauty category.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Lip Liner</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="Shop at skknbykim.com for Lip Liner" data-href="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/lip-liner?variant=42677825863864" data-product-url="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/lip-liner?variant=42677825863864" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fskknbykim.com%2Fcollections%2Fmakeup%2Fproducts%2Flip-liner%3Fvariant%3D42677825863864" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Shop at skknbykim.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/lip-liner?variant=42677825863864" data-vars-ga-product-id=83d00191-3022-4cae-aebb-cb08e413b632 data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.04 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=70882a4a-02d6-4256-ab98-734f2d289a0d data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-vars-ga-sku=42677825863864 data-vars-ga-magento-tracking=1 class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Lip Liner" title="Lip Liner" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1706294029-8.KKC_24_ECOMM_LIPLINER_NUDE01_OPEN_JAMIE_D_144DPI.jpg width=686 height=915 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>With the name SKKN, does that mean, then, that you’re taking a skin-first approach to makeup?

But some of the products will have hyaluronic acid, and just, like, formulas that are really moisturizing and nourishing for your skin. But I think it’s also just like with having just the essential nude tones. It’s just also enhancing your skin, enhancing what you want to look like, whether that’s a more natural look or whether that’s a fully glammed-up look. It’s just going to be the neutrals and the essentials that you need for your best skin for your best self.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Classic Mattes Eye Shadow Palette</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$50 at skknbykim.com for Classic Mattes Eye Shadow Palette" data-href="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/classic-mattes-eyeshadow-palette?variant=42681925370040" data-product-url="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/classic-mattes-eyeshadow-palette?variant=42681925370040" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fskknbykim.com%2Fcollections%2Fmakeup%2Fproducts%2Fclassic-mattes-eyeshadow-palette%3Fvariant%3D42681925370040" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$50 at skknbykim.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/classic-mattes-eyeshadow-palette?variant=42681925370040" data-vars-ga-product-brand="In stock" data-vars-ga-product-id=e67a3ec0-a446-48b7-bfb1-6e14031ba65c data-vars-ga-product-price=$50.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=7eb8c41f-3fb2-4b07-81d6-020058b8f34c data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="In stock" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Classic Mattes Eye Shadow Palette" title="Classic Mattes Eye Shadow Palette" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1706177578-10.KKC_24_ECOMM_CLASSIC_MATTES_EYESHADOW_OPEN_JAMIE_15193_F_3x4_JPEG_144DPI.jpg width=2048 height=2731 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Classic Mattes Eye Shadow Palette</h2></p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Over the last few years, I’ve seen so much chatter about how your lip liners were so missed.

I mean, I have people begging me … I have like major, major celebrities calling me, being like, “I’m begging you for this lipstick!” I would have like five left of stock from my personal stash, and I’d be like, “Okay, I’m gonna send you the last of the last.” So I was like, okay, we definitely have to launch with lip liners and lipsticks. We need to have more of a shade range, launch it with like a lot, and I am so excited because the response has been so amazing.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Do you think fans of the old KKW Beauty are going to be happy with the new products?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The amount of people that would just text me about everything! It just made me so happy that I could finally say, like, “It’s here. Finally!” It’s so funny that people write me for the most random shades, like, “Please, I need Nude 5.” And so I did a shade chart, so that people can see [that] if they liked a KKW Beauty color, then they would love this color from SKKN.</p><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Soft Matte Lip Color</h2></p><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# aria-label="$32 at skknbykim.com for Soft Matte Lip Color" data-href="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/soft-matte-lip-color?variant=42680035672248" data-product-url="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/soft-matte-lip-color?variant=42680035672248" data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1525079&url=https%3A%2F%2Fskknbykim.com%2Fcollections%2Fmakeup%2Fproducts%2Fsoft-matte-lip-color%3Fvariant%3D42680035672248" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-call-to-action="$32 at skknbykim.com" data-vars-ga-media-role data-vars-ga-media-type="Single Product Embed" data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://skknbykim.com/collections/makeup/products/soft-matte-lip-color?variant=42680035672248" data-vars-ga-product-brand="In stock" data-vars-ga-product-id=90686d28-27b3-45f5-9fc4-366a33577c0e data-vars-ga-product-price=$32.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=39b76ad8-fb3f-465e-8a50-e2a8023c9137 data-vars-ga-product-sem3-brand="In stock" data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" class="product-image-link ebgq4gw0 e1b8bpvs0 css-15xslai e1c1bym14"><img alt="Soft Matte Lip Color" title="Soft Matte Lip Color" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vader-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1706177895-8.KKC_24_ECOMM_LIPCOLOR_OPEN_CAP_NUDE01_JAMIE_C_144DPI.jpg width=2048 height=2730 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><h2 class="css-8ytyj0 e1bddzxd0">Soft Matte Lip Color</h2></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>I still have—and use—my KKW Beauty under-eye brightening product, even though it’s expired.

And so when I do my makeup myself, I used to do all mattes before, and now I like a little bit more creams. So I’ll do like more cream bronzer, cream blush, cream highlighter. And then mascara and lip liner, that’s my go-to. I quickly do concealer, just to kind of spot on my face.

So she’ll come in with her friends and they’ll do a full looks, but it’ll be like, “Hey, I’m gonna make you look like the Grinch today.” Or “I’m gonna make you look like Pikachu today.” It’s always a theme. I think they’re a little too young to be in that tween conversation. They like characters, and they like to re-create a character and then go from there, which I think is always really cute and fun, but then they wash it right off before they leave the room. It’s not like they want to wear it out.</p><h2 data-node-id=36 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>My last question: Everyone wants to know when the fragrances are coming back?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Fragrances are coming—I’m so excited.

And so, fragrance you definitely spray on your skin.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a5b794e4-ba0e-4527-9e9d-e98142b9fbef_1526586861.jpg alt="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" title="Headshot of Jenna Rosenstein" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Jenna Rosenstein is the Beauty Director at Harper's BAZAAR across both print and digital. While attending NYU, she held internships at Women’s Wear Daily, Bloomingdale’s, Harper’s BAZAAR, and Allure, the latter of which she parlayed into her first job as the Beauty Assistant. She left Allure three years later as the Senior Beauty Editor. She spent a few months at Refinery29 overseeing branded content in the same title, before finally landing back at BAZAAR to manage all beauty content. When she's not testing every lipstick known to mankind, getting zapped by new lasers, or interviewing experts and celebrities, you can find Rosenstein at home in New Jersey with her son, husband, and black cat named Maddie.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqaZm5rCsXvAbW1ubWRnf3p7yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlo6C4r3nMmqKeraBitq%2FAxKutop2nZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
