Harlow performed a clean version of his hit "First Class," but one Twitter user saw an opportunity to make up a fake fact about the show. "Jack Harlow has been fined $1 Million following his performance of ‘First Class’ on College GameDay,” @S_CharlesNFL wrote. “ESPN states that his lyric of 'I give her sweet, sweet, Semen' was extremely unprofessional for live TV, and he had signed off on blurring that lyric out of his performance."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Though it attracted lots of attention, the&nbsp;tweet was clearly false, as many fans pointed out that Harlow did in fact censor the lyric in question.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the "Churchill Downs" rapper got a kick out of the lie, and retweeted it himself.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After Harlow's tepid performance, the rapper joined the hosts of&nbsp;GameDay and offered up his predictions for the games of the day. He quickly got off-topic, however, delving into a story about how he dated someone from Cincinnati and that was why he liked the Bearcats. All in all, it was an eventful TV appearance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check out Harlow's&nbsp;GameDay performance below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdkZoR6f5ZmoZqbm2K1or7LqK5mnZ6ZvLO%2FxKxkraqfobluw8eoZKWhlZl6tbTArWShnV2srrR5xaKlnpxdqH6uecWoqWarlaKyr3nLsqmim12jsri%2F</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
