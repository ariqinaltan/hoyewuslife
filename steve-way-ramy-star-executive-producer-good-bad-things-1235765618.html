It’s a relationship that sparks a journey of transformation, self-acceptance and discovery for Danny, about himself and the beauty within his unique body.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Speaking to his decision to join the executive producing team of the film, which is currently in postproduction, Way said he “immediately knew that I wanted to be part of this special and groundbreaking” movie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“As a member of the disabled community and someone with a growing platform, I strive to uplift stories that shed light on people with disabilities and their journeys,” he continues. “Good Bad Things accomplishes just that.
