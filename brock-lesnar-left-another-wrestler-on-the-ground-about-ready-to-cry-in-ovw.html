He has held the titles of UFC Heavyweight Champion and NCAA Division I Heavyweight Champion outside of WWE. Brock Lesnar allegedly “backhanded” a wrestler once after getting the wrong end of a locker room joke.</p><p>Rip Rogers trained Lesnar in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), the old WWE developmental company between 2000 and 2002. At the time, OVW had a number of <a href=#>future main eventers, including Batista, John Cena, and Randy Orton</a>. Vivacious Charles, a different wrestler with less notoriety, was also on the roster.</p><p>Rogers described what transpired when Charles tried to make light of The Beast Incarnate on <a href=#>Stories with Brisco and Bradshaw</a>. He said that Brock just stood up and backhanded him. Rogers even said that Charles was down on the ground ready to cry.</p><p>This guy named Vivacious Charles just ribbed [pranked] Brock about something. Brock just stood up and backhanded him. Boom. Charles was on the ground about ready to cry. His jaw’s broke.</p><p>In the wrestling industry, “ribbing” in the locker room has been prevalent for years. While many wrestlers enjoy pulling practical jokes behind the scenes, some find it annoying when some jokes cross the line.</p><p>Rip Rogers withheld the specific action taken by Vivacious Charles to enrage Brock Lesnar. After the encounter, he understood that <a href=#>The Beast Incarnate was not the ideal person</a> to screw around with behind the scenes.
