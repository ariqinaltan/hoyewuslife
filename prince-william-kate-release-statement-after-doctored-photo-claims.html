The website reads: "These include cropping, dodging and burning, conversion into grayscale, elimination of dust on camera sensors and scratches on scanned negatives or scanned prints and normal toning and color adjustments.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFbv5dm3-R data-wc=39>"These should be limited to those minimally necessary for clear and accurate reproduction and that restore the authentic nature of the photograph.

The evictee said on<a class=hm-link href=#>Good Morning Britain</a>: "Obviously the family wouldn’t be the ones to do any touch-ups, so if that's gone through some filter before it's gone out to the broader world, but they wouldn't be doing photoshopping themselves."</p><p id=eFsCSWPixH8 data-wc=25>He added: “The smiles on faces said it all for me, I thought it was beautiful.... And this whole ‘sleevegate’ thing, just leave it alone."</p><p id=eGs-1bZUO- data-wc=39>After Princess Kate's statement, Sky News said an examination of the photo's meta data revealed it was saved in Adobe Photoshop twice on an Apple Mac on Friday and Saturday and the picture was taken on a Canon Camera.</p><p id=e3tOBbv2Gm data-wc=33>The Princess is known to be a keen photographer, and revealed in 2021 that she takes so many family photographs that her children sometimes object."Everyone's like, 'Mummy, please stop taking photographs.'" she said.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
