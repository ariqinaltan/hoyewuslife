That wasn’t me. I never thought to look neat when I was younger; I just felt really lucky to make it out of bed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It wasn’t until I became obsessed with old movies that I got interested in fashion. Black-and-white films from the ’40s were so glamorous, I wanted to crawl right onto the screen. Even now, when I’m watching something like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the Oscars</a>, most of the dresses I’m attracted to were pulled from the archives of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Valentino</a> or Oscar de la Renta or Givenchy. They might have been designed 30 years ago, but they’re timeless. I’ve found some great pieces in vintage shops, but I’ve never been the girl who walks into a store and spends $30,000 on a dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The truth is, when you’re a character actress, the studio doesn’t give you a big check to buy something to wear on a red carpet. Sometimes the wardrobe person on a set will gift me clothes, but I’m usually playing such strange people that I would never dress like them, to be honest. Stifler’s mom [her role in <i>American Pie</i>] certainly doesn’t reflect my style, and neither does Paulette [in <i>Legally Blonde</i>]. Poor Paulette really needs to find some flattering clothing.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Even though I’m very tall and not a size 2, I still love incredibly feminine pieces. My all-time favorite look was the pink ruffled Valentino Haute Couture dress that Lady Gaga wore to the première of <i>A Star Is Born</i>. It looked like a big pink powder-puff ball. I want to get married in that dress. I mean, how cool would it be to walk down the aisle in that? Sometimes when I’m looking for an outfit to wear on a red carpet, someone will suggest a “strong but severe” pantsuit. That’s not how I want to go; I always want the feminine dress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I don’t get it right every time — there have definitely been blunders. But if you have the choice to wear a killer look versus something you’re not pleased with, then there’s really only one option. Nothing is worse than getting out of a limo to do hours of press in an outfit you can’t stand. There was one première when I couldn’t find anything, and I ended up wearing a Prada raincoat without anything underneath. Since then I’ve learned that you need 10 fallbacks in your closet just in case.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Right now I love <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Christian Siriano</a> and Loewe. With Christian I’ve been lucky in that I can just throw on a dress. That’s usually impossible for me — it normally takes tons of fittings. I went to his show in the fall and everybody had their phones up to record, but I was too afraid I’d miss something. Later I had huge regrets — I wanted that whole thing on my phone! His clothing looks good on everyone. He knows women’s bodies; that’s for sure. He’s also an egoless guy.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Charles Sykes/Invision/AP/Shutterstock</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I feel the same way about the whole Loewe group. Jonathan Anderson and his design team are the coolest bunch of people I’ve ever met. They created an amazing dress for me for their holiday party last December. I hung it up in front of the giant window of my hotel room overlooking the New York City skyline, and it was almost as if another human being were in the room. I’d wake up like, “There it is again!” That was one of the best parties I’d been to in years. It was true artists coming together and creating, and it didn’t have that designery, formal, red-carpet feel. I think I was the last person to leave.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I feel like there’s a new thing happening in fashion where there’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>less snobbery and arrogance</a>. When you go up to a designer and say, “That is the most beautiful dress I’ve ever seen,” they don’t just stare at you and turn away because they’re so aloof. As I learn more and more about all this cool stuff, I’ve realized that there truly is a reason for fashion. It makes you feel better if you’re <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wearing the right thing</a>. It expresses who you are. For so many years I underestimated its importance, but I’m not going to do that anymore.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i>Coolidge stars in the drama </i>Promising Young Woman, <i>in theaters on April 17.</i></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For more stories like this, pick up the March issue of InStyle available on newsstands, on Amazon, and for <a title="(opens new window)" href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>digital download</a> Feb. 14.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8mepaehlpq%2Fbq%2FOqKOinJeaeqet0qGgqKZdpLmleceoo6Wxp6S8pXnGpZimp6Wn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
