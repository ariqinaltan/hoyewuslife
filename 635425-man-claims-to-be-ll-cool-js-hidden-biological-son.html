Though the claims didn’t necessarily stick, it’s not uncommon to see people on the internet claim that they’re related to a celebrity. Unfortunately, these types of <a href=# rel>allegations</a> can be quite harmful to the parties involved and are better addressed off the internet. These days, personal matters have a tendency to spill onto Instagram pages if you’re a high-profile figure.</p><p>It appears that <a href=# class=text-word rel>LL Cool J</a> may have found himself in a similar situation. Though he emerged onto the scene as the Ladies Man of rap, he hasn’t necessarily found himself in too many controversies surrounding his familial life. He married<a href=# rel> Simone Johnson</a> in 1995 after meeting in 1987. Nearly 30 years later, they’re still together with four children. However, a recently released video suggests that LL may have more children that we don’t know about.</p><span><h2 id=h-lovebenji-claims-to-be-ll-cool-j-s-hidden-son>LoveBenJi Claims To Be LL Cool J’s “Hidden Son”</h2></span><p>Over the weekend, a video of rapper LoveBenji began to circulate online as he made some wild claims surrounding his alleged father. BenJi claimed that he’s the “hidden son” of LL Cool J, though he’s only aware of his dad by his government name, James Todd Smith. BenJi claimed that LL made him sign a non-disclosure agreement because “they wanted to silence me,” though he felt that he needed to tell his truth.</p><p>“I feel like it should be public; now I need to just get this off my chest. I want to give thanks to you too, man. James Todd Smith, That’s what I know him as, [my] father [and] great man. But many of you probably know him as LL Cool J,” he said. He claimed that LL blocked him on socials, though he sends him $200 every once in a while. BenJi also stated that he tried to visit his father and his family in the past. “I really didn’t want to take it here and have the blogs blow it up or nothing like that…Since he’s blocking my number, I haven’t heard much from him. I feel like this is how I’ll be about to reach out to him. That’s my truth. Let me know, Dad,” he concluded.
