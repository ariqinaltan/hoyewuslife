Penning a heartfelt letter to fans, she explained:</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eMNnbLN6Bx6 data-wc=49>"Writing this feels bittersweet, as we've decided the fourth season will also be the final instalment of our show.

Netflix has also released a synopsis for season four. It reads: "Following the closure of Moordale Secondary, Otis and Eric now face a new frontier—their first day at Cavendish Sixth Form College. Otis is nervous about setting up his new clinic, while Eric is praying they won't be losers again. But Cavendish is a culture shock for all the Moordale students—they thought they were progressive but this new college is another level.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/733d26c985c5-otis-eric-and-adam-sex-education.jpg><p id=esmBvRB5uGF data-wc=60>"There's daily yoga in the communal garden, a strong sustainability vibe and a group of kids who are popular for being…kind?! Viv is totally thrown by the college's student-led, non-competitive approach, while Jackson is still struggling to get over Cal. Aimee tries something new by taking an Art A Level and Adam grapples with whether mainstream education is for him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/2ca929575ef0-maeve-sex-education.jpg><p id=ezpTA2ctRSN data-wc=41>"Over in the U.S., Maeve is living her dream at prestigious Wallace University, being taught by cult author Thomas Molloy.
