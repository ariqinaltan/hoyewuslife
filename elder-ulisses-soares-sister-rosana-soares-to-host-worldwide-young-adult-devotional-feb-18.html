Cook</a> of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and his wife, Sister Mary Cook, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>addressed five key concerns</a> for young adults in the Church: facing life and faith challenges, love and belonging, life planning and life balance, standing for truth, and receiving personal revelation and prophetic guidance.</p><p>The Apostle and his wife were joined by <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Elder Clark G. Gilbert</a>, a General Authority Seventy and the Church commissioner of education, and his wife, Sister Christine Gilbert. This devotional was recorded in the Marriott Center on BYU’s campus in Provo, Utah.</p><p></p><p>On May 21, 2023, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>President Dallin H. Oaks</a>, first counselor in the First Presidency, and his wife, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Sister Kristen M. Oaks</a>, encouraged young adults to <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>“combine and apply both law and love”</a> at a Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults.</p><p>The devotional, originating from the Conference Center Theater in Salt Lake City, offered loving counsel for young adults regarding marriage and dating. It also included counsel about how to stand fast with love while proclaiming truth, including on issues involving gender dysphoria and being romantically attracted to persons of the same sex.</p><p></p><p>On Jan. 8, 2023, then-<a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Elder Jeffrey R. Holland</a> of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and his late wife, <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>Sister Patricia T. Holland</a>, encouraged the global congregation <a class=link href=# data-cms-ai=0>to look to “a future filled with hope.”</a></p><p>At that Worldwide Devotional for Young Adults, held on the campus of Utah Tech University in St. George, Utah, President Holland, who is now acting president of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, offered a powerful declaration that young people must never lose sight of hope or its sister virtues — faith and charity. Sister Holland also invited listeners to simplify their lives and see the simple beauty of the gospel.</p><p>“Refuse to accept the world for what it appears to be,” President Holland said. “Shine the brightness of your hope on it and make it what it ought to be.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEnJ%2BuqpOdu6bD0meaqKVfobKisMSrqmhqYGeBcH2OanBoamRlgXV%2BkW1mnqSUmr9uwcuiqqydo2LAsK3Rnqpmq5mowaa%2BjKumrJmelnq0u8CrnKxlpKR6qbvSrWSwp6Khsbi1w55ksqelo7RurcOuo61llJrDsMDIqKWapF2bsqN5kHE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
