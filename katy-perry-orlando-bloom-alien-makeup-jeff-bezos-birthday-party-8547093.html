In a new Instagram post from the weekend, she shared a carousel of images that showed her and fianc√©&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Orlando Bloom</a> dressed to the nines ‚Äî with an alien-tinged twist. The two enlisted the help of special effects makeup artists Hugo Villasenor, Analyn Cruz, and Gabby Navarrete for out-of-this-world looks that included antennas, blanked-out eyebrows, and facial prosthetics.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Perry paired her prosthetics with a super-glam sequin gown with a sheer bodice and sky-high slit (perfect to show off her Gianvito Rossi heels). The design included draped panels of fabric that crisscrossed her torso and a dramatic pleated cape that she held up as she posed solo. For his part, Bloom wore a classic tux, though his pointy ears and exaggerated brow bones added just a touch of outer space detail.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Instagram/KatyPerry</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Makeup artist Patrick Ta was behind the rest of Perry's makeup look, writing on his own&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Instagram post</a>&nbsp;that "Mama Does Not Play When It Comes To A Themed Party."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"üöÄüõ∏üëΩspaced out and starry eyedüëΩüõ∏üöÄ," Perry wrote alongside the photos and a video clip. The "E.T." singer didn't share exactly where she went dressed like an interstellar goddess, but according to the comments, Kim Kardashian was also in attendance at the soir√©e. "I was obsessed with this look last night!!!!" she wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Mirror</a>, the party in question was Jeff Bezos‚Äôs 60th birthday party. The space theme was in line with the Amazon founder's Blue Origin project. The outlet also reported that Perry is on the verge of releasing new music. In the wake of her Las Vegas residency, she's ready to give her fans new tunes. The album is set to be "her most personal yet."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">‚ÄúShe has been doing it on her own terms and it is quite different from anything she has released before,‚Äù a source shared. They also noted that there was ‚Äúbig demand‚Äù for Katy to head out on tour again. She hasn't hit the road since 2018 and her last album,&nbsp;Smile, was released in 2020.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxYyoqaWZnpm8bq7LqKamZZGhtqa6jKaYpJ2lpXqrscWfZJudqqTAbq7Iq6uhnJGuerGt0a2wZnBlaYRxhZI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
