Sheff G had nothing but nice things to say about the former U.S. President. "One thing I wanna say," he began. "They always gonna whisper your accomplishments and shout your failures. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Trump gonna shout the wins for all of us</a>." Sleepy Hallow didn't say much as he stood nearby, though he did approach the microphone briefly to say "Make America great again."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The unexpected collab left many fans confused, and some <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">angry</a>. Peter Rosenberg, for example, recently shared his take on the endorsement on Ebro in the Morning. According to him, they should be pulled from Hot 97's Summer Jam lineup because of it. He didn't hesitate to channel his inner "Karen" and tell his higher-ups that, either.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-peter-rosenberg-slams-sheff-g-amp-sleepy-hallow-for-donald-trump-rally>Peter Rosenberg Slams Sheff G & Sleepy Hallow For Donald Trump Rally</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">In a clip from the episode, Rosenberg explains that the rally appeared to be a "big joke" to Sleepy Hallow, who he claims "laughed through" his entire endorsement. Regardless, he's not giving him a pass. In fact, that made it somewhat worse in his eyes, as he suggests it indicates he's not taking the issue seriously. "He could barely hold himself together from laughing," he said. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"What kind of endorsement is that?"</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Rosenberg went on to claim that he's asked a journalist friend of his to dig into why and how the appearance came about in the first place. What do you think of Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow speaking at Donald Trump's presidential rally in NYC?
