The fashion graduate told <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Sun </a>at Coachella’s Revolve party: “I messaged to congratulate him. We’re all good. I’m happy for him.” Sophia and Liam dated for two years before splitting up in October 2015. <a class=hm-link href=#>One Direction singer Liam</a>, 23, started his relationship with Cheryl, 33, the following year and the couple welcomed their baby boy last month. Fans are eagerly awaiting the announcement of their son’s name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7e118c583fac-liam-z.jpg><p id=eaTPlE012Y3 data-wc=12><strong>Liam Payne with his ex girlfriend Sophia Smith, before he dated&nbsp;Cheryl</strong></p><p id=eN0nB0eI2OD data-wc=91>Liam is currently in the US to work on his solo album, while <a class=hm-link href=#>Cheryl cares for their baby</a> at home in Woking, Surrey. Singer Liam has been entertaining his 13.2 million Instagram followers by posting a series of selfies showing his new edgy image as he perfects his debut album. His latest snap showed a coffee cup on a table next to a small figure of singer Pharrell, with Liam captioning the photo: “Coffee with @pharrell” and a laughing emoji. One follower wrote: “Happy 1 month to baby payno,” and another said, “Drop that album now.”</p><p id=eJQzHHNK8d_m data-wc=82>Liam’s fans were quick to notice the spoon on his coffee cup in the photo with many commenting on the cutlery. Back in 2015, Liam revealed to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Capital FM</a> that he has an issue with spoons. He said: “See I’m not so much scared of spoons, I’ll hold one. But I don’t like eating with them, if they’re not my spoons, if that makes sense.” Beside this weekend’s Instagram photo, one follower wrote: “Actually even I started hating spoons just coz I love you.”</p><p id=enFpJpNow1hW><a class=hm-link href=#>READ:&nbsp;New dad Liam Payne gushes about fatherhood for the first time during LA outing</a></p><p id=eDD89qRlGpRa data-wc=86>Cheryl meanwhile, is keeping a low profile at home since the arrival of her son.
