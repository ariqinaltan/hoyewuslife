However, he was detained in December 2022 after reportedly stabbing a number of people with sewing needles. For his podcast, It Is What It Is, Cam'Ron visited the hospital where Gordon was being held. “At 11:15 this morning, former NBA player Ben Gordon was detained and taken to Harlem hospital after witnesses say he was trying to stab random people with sewing needles,” Cam wrote on Instagram alongside the video at the time. This is all speculation at this point. But Ben seems to been having mental health issues for a while. Let’s hope he gets the help he needs," Cam'Ron wrote on Instagram. More recently, <a href=# rel>Cam'Ron threatened to get Gordon institutionalized</a>.</p><p>After being released in December, Gordon responded to Cam'Ron's remarks. “Cameras is Cam’ron-ing,” he said. “To think a grown man drove from where he was to come mock — fuck outta here, man. That n-gga silly. Yo look, libel, slander is a real thing, man. My lawyers is lawyering. I know you like to say shit like that. Yeah, my computers is computing, that’s what your shits is doing? Fuck outta here, gang. It was a black-on-black crime that day. Cam’ron, you know, they probably called the police and everything on me … Them boys set me up. The cameras is Camron-ing. Kodak Camron-ing coming soon … I ain’t got nothing to lose. I got paper too, n-gga. Fuck outta here, bum ass n-ggas.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cam-ron-squashes-the-beef>Cam'Ron Squashes The Beef</h2></span><p>Appearing on Good Day New York, Cam'Ron made it clear that he had no bad blood towards Gordon. “So look, let me explain what happened with Ben Gordon,” Cam’ron began. “It’s funny, my brother is over there who started this whole thing. So I did a report on Ben Gordon and I’m not going to talk about Ben — wassup, Ben?." Furthermore, Cam'Ron continued. “He didn’t like it so much so he tried to get at me so I got back at him. But it’s all fun and games, you know, I love Ben. I got a lot a love for Ben.”</p><p>Additionally, Cam'Ron waved off any fears of Gordon's physical threats. "Ben’s cool. Ben’s my mans,” Cam continued. “It’s all fun and games, at least on my behalf. I think it’s all fun and games. I don’t have a problem with Ben. You gotta ask Ben about the sewing needles. I ain’t have nothing to do with the sewing needles, but as far as I’m concerned, it’s over with. I love Ben Gordon. If he has a problem with me, hopefully we can get on the phone and fix it.” Gordon is yet to comment on Cam'Ron's comments but it's clear that the sports personality has no interest in continuing the beef.
