On Thursday, the 25-year-old daughter of former U.S. president Barack Obama attended the 2024 Sundance Film Festival at Prospector Square Theater in Park City, Utah for the premiere of her short film, The Heart, which she both wrote and directed.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The film's debut marked Malia's first-ever red carpet appearance, and by the looks of her ultra-cozy outfit, she definitely got the Sundance style memo. Rather than heels and cocktail dresses that are the norm at other movie screenings, Sundance takes a much more casual approach to red carpet dressing with a focus on outerwear given the snowy conditions. And like a pro, Malia wore an ensemble that was equal parts cozy and chic.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sporting a long gray wool coat with a blue-striped button-down and black leggings underneath, Malia accessorized with a pair of brown chunky, lug-soled boots while adding the ultimate Y2K relic to her low-key outfit. Wrapped around her neck was a gray knitted skinny scarf that was a few shades darker than her jacket and extended past its calf-length hemline. Malia wore her hair down in relaxed waves with a center part and added several small braids, before finishing off her glam with a fresh-faced glow.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Heart is a story is about a grieving son whose dead mother left him with an unusual request in her will. In the film festival's "Meet the Artist" segment, Malia provided more a bit insight, adding: “The film is about lost objects and lonely people and forgiveness and regret, but I also think it works hard to uncover where tenderness and closeness can exist in those things."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She concluded, “We hope you enjoy the film and it makes you feel a bit less lonely, or at least reminds you not to forget about the people who are."&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-more-in-celeb-news></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>More in Celeb News</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zJqjopldpK%2BiucBmqZ6cXZius7zErWSdnZKqwW5%2Bj2trZqulo7GiusKeZJ%2BhnKJ6p7HSraCvmZxihXZ%2FlWpsbQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
