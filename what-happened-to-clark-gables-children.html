Clark was quoted as having told a reporter regarding his impending fatherhood, "This is a dividend that has come too late in life.&nbsp;When I wind up this picture I'm taking off until after the baby is born. I want to be there and I want to be there a good many months afterward." John Clark Gable (above) was born four months after his father's death. In 2000, the <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a> published a feature on the younger Gable, who was preparing to race in the Baja 500 off-road race.&nbsp;</p><p>John, then 39, noted that his father was also interested in road racing, even starring as a race car driver in the 1950 film "To Please A&nbsp;Lady." "I think my father's love of auto racing, which I learned about from my mother, has been a special bond with his memory. My mom ... tried to discourage me from racing but I just knew it was in my blood. She even hid all my dad's racing memorabilia from me," noted John. The younger Gable has also acted in a handful of films, including an appearance in the 1994 television movie "<a href=#>A Burning Passion:&nbsp;The Margaret Mitchell Story</a>," a biopic of the woman who wrote the novel "<a href=#>Gone With The Wind</a>."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFkWlobG5frLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScpJGnuG6zwJujnqtdmLWquMOrnKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
