They revealed Majors was concerned about a possible overdose or suicide and that they found Jabbari on the floor in Majors' apartment when they arrived.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">When she came to, Jabbari was worried whether Majors was around and asked why her ear hurt, seemingly unable to recall. While the ear injury is one of the causes of the trial, officers didn’t ask how she obtained it at the time. Jabbari did, however, tell the officers that Majors hit her in the head several times and grabbed her by the throat.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-jonathan-majors-amp-meagan-good-arrive-in-court>Jonathan Majors & Meagan Good Arrive In Court</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 4: Jonathan Majors and Meagan Good are seen arriving at court on December 4, 2023 in New York, New York.

They had Jabbari fill out a domestic violence report. Additionally, Majors' 911 call was played for the jury. In the audio, he says “she’s unconscious,” and describes her as “my ex-partner.” The operator instructed Majors to “keep an eye on her breathing.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Jabbari previously testified on the stand, detailing her violent relationship with Majors. In doing so, she said she was often afraid of the&nbsp;Creed III&nbsp;actor and recalled several concerning incidents. She said: “I felt I was existing in his world. Emotionally and physically, all these ways. I didn’t feel my autonomy. I had low self-esteem, I lost weight, I felt unconfident, I felt really dependent on him. He was the only one who knew what went on. I found it hard to [see my family and friends]. I felt I was lying to them.” Be on the lookout for further updates on Jonathan Majors’ trial on HotNewHipHop.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
