As many members of the rap industry expressed their disappointment in Nicki's decision to work with 6ix9ine again, including Future, Tekashi 6ix9ine lashed out and brought up the ATL rapper's baby mama situation. "Future, you don't take care of your kids, right? You can't compare me to you because I can't have no communication with mine. My baby mama was having sexual relations with my co-defendant," 6ix9ine explained.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Sara Molina went on Instagram Live shortly after where she aired out Tekashi 6ix9ine and essentially called bullshit on his claims. "He's no better than Future because he has another kid that he just doesn't take care of," she said after she stated that there was no communication in the first place. She also stated that 6ix9ine had communication with his daughter while he was in jail, though that didn't continue after his release.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Though Sara Molina was relatively calm as she aired out her grievances,&nbsp;it was her mother that finally went off on 6ix9ine's overall behavior. "I was talkin' to him. I was even letting his mother see the baby. His mother, his brother. What happened to all of them that care about my daughter?" She's heard saying off camera. "Stop copping her name to promote your music to get dollars. You don't pay no child support, you bum ass."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Check the full clip below.&nbsp;</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Aron A. is a features editor for HotNewHipHop.
