A failed <span data-scayt_word=supervillain data-scaytid=34>supervillain</span> who was presumed dead for years — when, actually, his body was in a transformative state, changing into his fully-powered form — Williams’ first tenure as an Avenger in the <span data-scayt_word=1970s data-scaytid=35>1970s</span> was marked by an inability to act because of a fear of being plunged back into his death-like state; by the time he got over that, he’d moved to Los Angeles to become a <span data-scayt_word=stuntman data-scaytid=36>stuntman</span> and actor. While out West in the <span data-scayt_word=1980s data-scaytid=37>1980s</span>, he helped found the West Coast Avengers, where his newfound ego proved to be troublesome for his teammates.</p><p>Turned out, however, his fear of dying — or almost dying, at least — was well-founded; he would be blown up while fighting aliens in the ‘<span data-scayt_word=90s data-scaytid=38>90s</span>, only to be resurrected by the Scarlet Witch some years later. Since then, his career has been beset by mental instability potential brought on by his own energy powers, despite which he’s served with the Avengers on two separate occasions and been absorbed into the body of former X-Men member Rogue seemingly permanently.</p><p>Simon Williams, in other words, can’t win for losing, which is what makes his near-brush with real-world cinematic fame feel par for the course for the character. Think of him as the Charlie Brown of the superhero set … and hope that he’ll get to show up on the big screen one day soon.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKjBwKubopmeqHqorcuar7JlYmLEqcWMn5inq12Wv6Z5xaWgqaiZo7Rur9StZJygkaeupMDEq2RycWZogHd7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
