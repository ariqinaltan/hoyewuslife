He formed his first band, 1984, during his time at Hampton Grammar School. However, in 1970, when he teamed up with Freddie Mercury and Roger Taylor, the legendary band Queen was born. With hits like "Bohemian Rhapsody," "We Will Rock You," and "The Show Must Go On," Queen quickly rose to global fame, solidifying Brian's place as one of the greatest guitarists in rock history.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beyond-music-an-astrophysicist>Beyond Music: An Astrophysicist</h2></span><p>British rock band Queen, London, 1973.

His work in stereoscopy, a technique for creating depth illusions, is noteworthy, leading to several book publications. Moreover, he co-founded Asteroid Day with esteemed astrophysicists to raise awareness about asteroids and their potential impact on Earth.</p><p>Brian's passion extends to animal rights. He founded the Save Me Trust, campaigning against fox hunting and badger culling in the UK.
