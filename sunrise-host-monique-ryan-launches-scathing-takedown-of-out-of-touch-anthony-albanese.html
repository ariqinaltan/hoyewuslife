He must’ve been versing himself on those since about four this morning.”</p><p>Wright asked Mr Joyce if today’s polling was a sign that “Peter Dutton is winning back the Howard battlers” from Labor.</p><p>He claimed the government went to the last election promising cost-of-living release and then, once elected, began focusing on “constitutional change and climate change” instead.</p><p>“Just get the basics right. People get annoyed with the Labor Party because they talked about cost-of-living before the election and then they flirt with all these other issues and get the basics wrong.</p><p>“They’re not focused on the things that people who are working … [need].”</p><p>An apparent case in point of Mr Albanese being “out of touch” came with coverage of his visit to a winery in the Margaret River last week.</p><p>While holidaying in the region with his partner Jodi Haydon, he was pictured sampling a glass of wine from a bottle that costs an eye-watering $500.</p><p>“Given how many Aussies are struggling with just paying the basic bills, is this a bad look?” Wright asked.</p><p>Mr Burke shot back that he’s “blown away this one’s even a story” and said the PM is “taking a holiday in Australia, backing Australian small businesses”.</p><p>“Good on him,” he said.</p><p>“I know there’s been some newspaper articles and [criticism from] Michaelia Cash, who’s meant to be representing those small businesses in WA.</p><p>“Most people are of the view, particularly at this time of year, that if someone’s taking a few days off, that’s OK. And if they’re doing it by backing Australian small businesses, then good on ‘em.”</p><p>West Australian Liberal Senator Michaelia Cash launched a scathing attack over the photo, saying it shows Mr Albanese “has lost touch with the struggles of everyday Australians”.</p><p>“Many Australians are battling with even the basics this Christmas — let alone tasting expensive bottles of wine. It’s a grim economic scenario that many Australian households now face this Christmas in particular with food inflation,” Senator Cash told the West Australian newspaper.</p><p>But her Coalition colleague Mr Joyce agreed with Mr Burke’s sentiment, saying “I don’t care” about the criticism of Mr Albanese’s pricey plonk but did quip that he’s “really happy” he’s in Australia.</p><p>The Opposition has frequently criticised the PM’s repeated travels internationally on trade and diplomatic missions, branding him “Airbus Albo”.</p><p>But on the vineyard visit furore that’s erupted, he said: “First of all, no bottle of wine is worth five hundred bucks. How do people think that something that goes down your gullet and ends up in the toilet is worth $500 a bottle.</p><p>“I don’t care. I worry about all ranges of things but not if the PM has a bottle of wine.</p><p>“I’m worried about cost-of-living – people can’t afford their groceries, can’t afford their power bill, can’t afford their fuel and can’t afford their rent. That’s the thing people are talking about – that’s what’s worrying people.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label="Anthony Albanese" data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Anthony Albanese</a><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label="Labor Party" data-tgev-order=2 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Labor Party</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmny4u9GkZqWdkZmys7%2BOrKynqpmosm60zqyrZqWfo7aywcRmqbKZnmK5osHNnJ%2Beq12osKLAx6KloGWklrimsM6wpWanlmK8tsCMqJ1mrJ%2BqsKl5wKeroaeernqiuMGapZ6rlWS7psPSZqqtp6KufHWylmxqcJ2WbK95f5VxmmyelWuzdq6Ta25rcWlnhqKF</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZestD - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
